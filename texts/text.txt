In the song 500 Chunks, a Minecraft parody of the song I'm Gonna Be by "The Proclaimers", an excerpt of the lyrics is "Well, I would walk 500 chunks, and I would walk 500 more." Thus it can be concluded that the person in question wishes to walk a total of 100 chunks. A "chunk" is a unit of measurement in the sandbox game Minecraft, and this chunk equates to 16 "blocks". Assuming that a block is equal in length to 1 meter in every axis, that puts a chunk at 16 meters. This means that 500 chunks would be 8000 meters, or 8 kilometers, which puts 1000 chunks at 16 kilometers, or just under 10 miles. This means that the distance traveled in the parody is less than a hundredth the distance traveled in the original song.
