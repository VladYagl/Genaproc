Sometimes, when the good knight his rest would take,
It is reflected, clearly, in a lake,
With the young ashen boughs, 'gainst which its rests,

And th' half seen mossiness of linnets' nests.
Ah shall I ever tell its cruelty,
When the fire flashes from a warrior's eye,
And his tremendous hand is grasping it,
And his dark brow for very wrath is knit ?

Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,
Leaps to the honours of a tournament,
And makes the gazers round about the ring

Just as the sun was from the east uprising ;
And, as for him some gift she was devising,

Beheld thee, plucked thee, cast thee in the stream
To meet her glorious brother's greeting beam.
I marvel much that thou hast never told
How, from a flower, into a fish of gold
Apollo changed thee ; how thou next didst seem
A black-eyed swan upon the widening stream ;
And when thou first didst in that mirror trace

For one whose palate gladdens in the flavour

Of sparkling Helicon
To take him to a desert rude, and bare,
:

Who had on Baiae's shore reclined at ease,
While Tasso's page was floating in a breeze
That gave soft music from Armida's bowers,
Mingled with fragrance from her rarest flowers

The wronged Libertas who has told you stories
Of laurel chaplets, and Apollo's glories
Of troops chivalrous prancing through a city,
And tearful ladies made for love and pity

The grand, the sweet, the terse, the free, the fine
What swelled with pathos, and what right divine

:

Spenserian vowels that elope with ease,

And

float along like birds o'er summer seas ;
Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness ;
Michael in arms, and more, meek Eve's fair slenderness.

Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly
Up to its climax and then dying proudly?
Who found for me the grandeur of the ode,
Growing, like Atlas, stronger from its load ?
Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,

The

sharp, the rapier-pointed epigram ?
that epic was of all the king,

Showed me
Round,

vast,

and spanning

all like

Saturn's ring ?

You too upheld the veil from Clio's beauty,
And pointed out the patriot's stern duty
The might of Alfred, and the shaft of Tell
The hand of Brutus, that so grandly fell
Upon a tyrant's head. Ah had I never seen.
Or known your kindness, what might I have been ?
What my enjoyments in my youthful years,
Bereft of all that now my life endears ?
And can I e'er these benefits forget ?
And can I e'er repay the friendly debt ?

No, doubly no ; yet should these rhymings please,
I shall roll on the grass with twofold ease
For I have long time been my fancy feeding
With hopes that you would one day think the reading

Of my rough verses not an hour misspent ;
Should it e'er be so, what a rich content
Some weeks have passed since last I saw the spires
In lucent Thames reflected
warm desires

To see the sun o'erpeep the eastern dimness,
And morning shadows streaking into slimness

To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter ;
To feel the air that plays about the hills,
And sips its freshness from the little rills
To see high, golden corn wave in the light
When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,
And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,
;

As though she were reclining in a bed
Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed.

Of a peculiar sort a consummation ;

no other verdure than its own

To sit upon an Alp as on a throne,
And half forget what world or worldling meant.

A DREAM,
AFTER READING DANTE'S EPISODE OF PAULO AND FRANCESCA.

As Hermes once took

When

swooned and slept ;
So on a Delphic reed my idle sprite
So played, so charmed, so conquered, so bereft
The dragon world of all its hundred eyes ;
lulled Argus, baffled,

And

seeing it asleep, so fled away
Not unto Ida, with its snow-cold skies ;
Nor unto Tempe, where Jove grieved a day

But to that second circle of sad hell,
Where, 'mid the gust, the whirlwind, and the flow
Of rain and hailstones, lovers need not tell
Their sorrows. Pale were the sweet lips I saw ;
Pale were the lips I kissed, and fair the form
I floated with

'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid
In muffling hands. So tempered, out he strayed
Half seeing visions that might have dismayed

'twas very sweet ; he stayed
His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid
His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,

And so he kept, until the rosy veils
Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand
Were lifted from the water's breast, and fanned
Into sweet air ; and sobered morning came

Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.
From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,

Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,

And wound with many a river to its head,
To find where this sweet nymph prepared her secret bed
In vain the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,
And so he rested, on the lonely ground,
;

Pensive, and full of painful jealousies
Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.

There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,
Such as once heard, in genlle heart, destroys
All pain but pity

thus the lone voice spake

:

:

"

When move in a sweet body fit for life,
And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife

Until he found a palpitating snake,
Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.

She was a gordian shape of dazzling hue,
Vermilion-spotted, golden, green, and blue ;
Striped like a zebra, freckled like a pard,
Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barred

And

;

of silver moons, that, as she breathed,
Dissolved, or brighter shone, or interwreathed
full

Their lustres with the gloomier tapestries
So rainbow-sided, touched with miseries,

She seemed, at once, some penanced lady elf,
Some demon's mistress, or the demon's self.
Upon her crest she wore a wannish fire
Sorinkled with

stars, like

Ariadne's tiar :

Haunters of cavern, lake, and waterfall,

As a real woman, lineal indeed
From Pyrrha's pebbles or old Adam's seed.
Thus gentle Lamia judged, and judged aright,
That Lycius could not love in half a fright,
So threw the goddess off, and won his heart
More pleasantly by playing woman's part,
With no more awe than what her beauty gave,

DEEP in the shady sadness of a vale
Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,
Sat grey-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone,
Still as the silence round about his lair ;

Forest on forest hung about his head
Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,
Not so much life as on a summer's day

Robs not one

light seed from the feathered grass,
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A stream went voiceless by, still deadened mow

It seemed no force could wake him from his place j

As when, upon a tranced summer night,
Those green-robed senators of mighty woods,

Dream, and so dream all night without a stir,

Hyperion was one of the Titans the children of Earth and Heaven
They are spoken of as the elder gods. The names of
the chief of them were, Oceanus, Hyperion, lapetus, and Ophion, males ; and
Themis, Mnemosyne, and Eurymone, females.
Hyperion was the original
sun-god, and was represented with a more glorious beauty than that of Apollo,
who succeeded him. Of the Titans, Ophion and Eurymone reigned on
Olympus, till they were dethroned by Saturn and Cybele. Milton alludes tf

ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE,

MY heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk

:

Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,

But being too happy in thine happiness. i

in full-throated ease.

Cooled a long age in the deep-delved earth,

Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,

Though the dull brain perplexes and retards

Already with thee tender is the night,
And haply the Queen-Moon is on^her throne,
Clustered around by all her starry Fays ;

But here there is no light,
Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

cannot see what flowers are at

my

feet,

Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
Wherewith the seasonable month endows
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild

White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine ;
Fast fading violets covered up in leaves
And mid-May's eldest child,
The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer

There are four seasons in the mind of man

Takes in all beauty with an easy span.
He has his Summer, when luxuriously

To

Is nearest unto heaven ; quiet coves

to let fair things

Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.
He has his Winter, too, of pale misfeature,

And her house was out of doors.

There is a pleasure on the heath, where Druids old have been,
Where mantles grey have rustled by, and swept the nettled green ;

New to the feet although each tale a hundred times be told ;
There is a deeper joy than all, more solemn in the heart,
More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart.

March, 1818.

DEAR Reynolds as last night I lay in bed,
There came before my eyes that wonted thread
Of shapes, and shadows, and remembrances,
That every other minute vex and please
Things all disjointed come from north and south,
Two Witch's eyes above a Cherub's mouth,
Voltaire with casque and shield and habergeon,
And Alexander with his nightcap on ;
Old Socrates a-tying his cravat,
And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat ;
:

And

Junius Brutus, pretty well, so so,
Making the best of's way towards Soho.

Few

are there

who escape

these visitings,

Perhaps one or two whose lives have patent wings,
And thro' whose curtains peeps no hellish nose,
No wild-boar tushes, and no Mermaid's toes ;
But flowers bursting out with lusty pride,

And young

POEMS AND SONNETS.

THE EVE OF SAINT MARK.
(UNFINISHED.)

UPON

a Sabbath day it fell ;
Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell,

That called the

folk to evening prayer

;

The city streets were clean and fair
From wholesome drench of April rains

;

And, on the western window panes,

The chilly sunset faintly told
Of unmatured green valleys cold,
Of the green thorny bloomless hedge,
Of rivers new with spring-tide sedge,
Of primroses by sheltered rills,
And daisies on the aguish hills.
Twice holy was the Sabbath-bell
The silent streets were crowded well
With staid and pious companies,
:

Warm

from their

fire-side orat'ries

;

And moving, with demurest air,
To even-song, and vesper prayer,
Each arched porch, and entry low,
filled with patient folk and slow,
With whispers hush, and shuffling feet,
While played the organ loud and sweet.
The bells had ceased, the prayers begun
And Bertha had not yet half done
A curious volume, patched and torn,
That all day long, from earliest morn,

And

Bertha was a maiden

Dwelling in th' old minster-square

Sidelong, its rich antiquity,

outstript,

By no sharp north-wind ever nipt,
So sheltered by the mighty pile.
Bertha arose, and read awhile,
With forehead 'gainst the window-pane.
Again she tried, and then again,
Until the dusk eve left her dark
Upon the legend of St. Mark.
From plaited lawn-frill, fine and thin,
She lifted up her soft warm chin,
With aching neck and swimming eyes,
And dazed with saintly imag'ries.
All was gloom,

and

silent all,

Save now and then the still foot-fall
Of one returning homewards late,
Past the echoing minster-gate.

The clamorous daws that all the day
Above tree-tops and towers play,
Pair by pair had gone to rest,
Each in its ancient belfry-nest,

Where

asleep they fall betimes,
the drowsy chimes.

Then one poor year a thousand years would be,
The flush of welcome ever on the cheek
So could we live long life in little space,

So time itself would be annihilate,
So a day's journey in oblivious haze
To serve our joys would lengthen and dilate.
O to arrive each Monday morn from Ind
To land each Tuesday from the rich Levant
In little time a host of joys to bind,
And keep our souls in one eternal pant
This morn, my friend, and yester-evening taught
Me how to harbour such a happy thought.
