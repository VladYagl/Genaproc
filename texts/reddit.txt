I greatly respect how biologically they are better suited for homemaking and child raising and having long locks of hair and expressing themselves emotionally, leaving the fighting of terrorism and exploration of the cosmos and thinking deep and wonderful rational thoughts to us manly men.

(ﾉ´ヮ´)ﾉ: ･ﾟhehehe\~penis-kun is so adorable (●´Д｀●)・ How could anyone get off to the idea of removing a loli's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke. I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax,hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her,pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she murmurs breathlessly,"You came so much inside of me", then her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside again.

At eight years old I got the opportunity to star in a Barney the Dinosaur live action film; I was ecstatic because my first acting role in a film was going to be something as well known as Barney.

 The filming went well, but I couldn't help but get a slightly off vibe about Barney. The actor in the suit never left character; there's an acting technique involving trying to be your character to maximize the effectiveness of your acting but I doubt he would be using this on something as mundane as Barney, not to mention I never once saw him take off the suit. 

Another thing which unsettled me about the Barney suit was how when you approached it, there was a strong smell of sweat; as if there was a person roasting inside a Brazen Bull in that dinosaur outfit. Nonetheless, we had to bare with the odor for the entire shoot. Halfway through the first couple of weeks shooting, the Barney actor's behavior started to change. He seemed to enjoy constantly rubbing against the different child actors and touching us unnecessarily. 

It was coming up to my ninth birthday but Barney seemed to regard everyone on set as being four years old and completely unaware that he was not an actual anthropomorphic dinosaur; he referred to himself around the children as just 'Barney' and as I said; his voice never changed on and off set. Now, all of these things were pretty unsettling but really; it was nothing to write home about... well, that was until the last day of filming. 

The shoot went well, Barney didn't seem to be up to his usual tricks of feeling up the child actors, but he was unusual silent towards crew and the actors, only saying the necessary lines as if he didn't want to be there. I finished my final scene, however; Barney had one more scene to shoot. Lunch break was called and most of the crew went off to Denny's to enjoy the last day they'd be working together. My parents let me be fairly autonomous on set since they trusted all the crew to keep me safe; some bald middle-aged crew member with a goatee was designated to look after the child actors off set. That day, a bunch of the kids wanted to go to the bathroom. The crew member told the Barney actor to look after me and two others while he took them to the restrooms on the other side of the studio. I felt rather unsettled to be left alone with Barney and mostly stuck around with the other kids while we waited for him to return. After a couple of minutes of Barney being completely silent; just sitting down on a chair offset, he asked me - in character, if I'd like to go to see the Muppets set.

I wasn't a big fan of Muppets as a kid, but I was excited to be getting an exclusive look at it and begrudgingly accepted. Barney said he would "look after me" and took my hand; he held it very tightly. As we were leaving the Barney & Friends set, I asked why he was leaving behind the other kids (I thought he was asking all of us). Barney was silent for a second before responding; "You kids wait here for just a couple of minutes." 

I was uncomfortable but I trusted that the trip would only be a few minutes; once we got to the so called Muppets set, Barney opened the door and pushed me into the building. It was an empty set. I was suddenly shaking with fear as Barney closed the door behind me. Barney reached down and began taking off the lower half of his suit. I felt an urge to run, but there was nowhere to go. I just stood trembling in fear as he threw aside part of his suit; now, standing in front of me was a man with hairy legs in light grey boxers and the Barney torso and head on top.

I don't want to say what happened after that. All I can really remember is the cold inanimate eyes of the Barney suit fixed on me.  After the event, Barney took me back on set. The crew had returned from lunch but our break wasn't quite over. When the crew asked where we had been, Barney responded in a deep male voice; "I just went to show him around the set." My mom picked me up after that and we went home. I couldn't sleep for weeks afterwards. Today I still have counselling.﻿Don't quote me on this, but Jack Sparrow could of said harambe is my friend you moron ayy lmao thanks Obama RemindMe! 2 minutes needs more jpeg autism speaks /u/Trollabot Cummybot2000 weird idiot ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⢛⢛⡛⡻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠛⢛⠻⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⢟⢱⡔⡝⣜⣜⢜⢜⡲⡬⡉⢕⢆⢏⢎⢇⢇⣧⡉⠿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⡟⡱⣸⠸⢝⢅⢆⢖⣜⣲⣵⣴⣱⣈⡣⣋⢣⠭⣢⣒⣬⣕⣄⣝⡻⢿⣿⣿ ⣿⠟⡜⣎⢎⢇⢇⣵⣷⣿⣿⡿⠛⠉⠉⠛⢿⣦⢵⣷⣿⣿⣿⠟⠛⠋⠓⢲⡝⣿ ⢏⢰⢱⣞⢜⢵⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠐⠄⠄⠄⠄⢹⣻⣿⣿⣿⠡⠄⠄⠄⠄⠄⠹⣺ ⢕⢜⢕⢕⢵⠹⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡀⠸⠗⣀⠄⠄⣼⣻⣿⣿⣿⡀⢾⠆⣀⠄⠄⣰⢳ ⡕⣝⢜⡕⣕⢝⣜⢙⢿⣿⣿⣷⣦⣤⣥⣤⣾⢟⠸⢿⣿⣿⣿⣦⣄⣉⣤⡴⢫⣾ ⡪⡪⣪⢪⢎⢮⢪⡪⡲⢬⢩⢩⢩⠩⢍⡪⢔⢆⢏⡒⠮⠭⡙⡙⠭⢝⣨⣶⣿⣿ ⡪⡪⡎⡮⡪⡎⡮⡪⣪⢣⢳⢱⢪⢝⢜⢜⢕⢝⢜⢎⢧⢸⢱⡹⡍⡆⢿⣿⣿⣿ ⡪⡺⡸⡪⡺⣸⠪⠚⡘⠊⠓⠕⢧⢳⢹⡸⣱⢹⡸⡱⡱⡕⡵⡱⡕⣝⠜⢿⣿⣿ ⡪⡺⡸⡪⡺⢐⢪⢑⢈⢁⢋⢊⠆⠲⠰⠬⡨⡡⣁⣉⠨⡈⡌⢥⢱⠐⢕⣼⣿⣿ ⡪⣪⢣⢫⠪⢢⢅⢥⢡⢅⢅⣑⡨⡑⠅⠕⠔⠔⠄⠤⢨⠠⡰⠠⡂⣎⣼⣿⣿⣿ ⠪⣪⡪⡣⡫⡢⡣⡣⡣⡣⡣⣣⢪⡪⡣⡣⡲⣑⡒⡎⡖⢒⣢⣥⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⢁⢂⠲⠬⠩⣁⣙⢊⡓⠝⠎⠮⠮⠚⢎⡣⡳⠕⡉⣬⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⢐⠐⢌⠐⠅⡂⠄⠄⢌⢉⠩⠡⡉⠍⠄⢄⠢⡁⡢⠠⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠠⠱⠁⠞⠀⠮⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠀⠙⠊⠙⠀⠽⠀⠚⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠬⠀⠎⠁⠽⠀⠁⠃⠀⠍⠑⠂⠀⠽⠀⠇⠇⠀⠃⠊⠞⠡⠦⠀⠠⠊⠠⠴⠇⠇⠀⠓⠀⠽⠀⠐⠅⠀⠠⠊⠀⠛⠗⠁⠙⠥⠁⠞⠫⠀⠞⠕⠏⠀⠷⠀⠍⠽⠀⠉⠇⠁⠎⠎⠀⠔⠀⠮⠀⠠⠝⠁⠧⠽⠀⠠⠎⠂⠇⠎⠂⠀⠯⠀⠠⠊⠠⠴⠧⠑⠀⠃⠑⠑⠝⠀⠔⠧⠕⠇⠧⠫⠀⠔⠀⠝⠥⠍⠻⠳⠎⠀⠎⠑⠉⠗⠑⠞⠀⠗⠁⠊⠙⠎⠀⠕⠝⠀⠠⠁⠇⠤⠠⠟⠥⠁⠫⠁⠂⠀⠯⠀⠠⠊⠀⠓⠀⠕⠧⠻⠀⠼⠉⠚⠚⠀⠉⠕⠝⠋⠊⠗⠍⠫⠀⠅⠊⠇⠇⠎⠲⠀⠠⠊⠀⠁⠍⠀⠞⠗⠁⠔⠫⠀⠔⠀⠛⠕⠗⠊⠇⠇⠁⠀⠺⠜⠋⠜⠑⠀⠯⠀⠠⠊⠠⠴⠍⠀⠮⠀⠞⠕⠏⠀⠎⠝⠊⠏⠻⠀⠔⠀⠮⠀⠑⠝⠞⠊⠗⠑⠀⠠⠠⠥⠀⠜⠍⠫⠀⠿⠉⠑⠎⠲⠀⠠⠽⠀⠜⠑⠀⠝⠕⠹⠬⠀⠞⠕⠀⠍⠑⠀⠃⠀⠚⠀⠁⠝⠕⠮⠗⠀⠞⠜⠛⠑⠞⠲⠀⠠⠊⠀⠺⠀⠺⠊⠏⠑⠀⠽⠀⠮⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠀⠳⠀⠾⠀⠏⠗⠑⠉⠊⠨⠝⠀⠮⠀⠇⠊⠅⠑⠎⠀⠷⠀⠱⠀⠓⠁⠎⠀⠝⠐⠑⠀⠃⠑⠑⠝⠀⠎⠑⠑⠝⠀⠆⠋⠀⠕⠝⠀⠹⠀⠠⠑⠜⠹⠂⠀⠍⠜⠅⠀⠍⠽⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠬⠀⠘⠺⠎⠲⠀⠠⠽⠀⠹⠔⠅⠀⠽⠀⠉⠀⠛⠑⠞⠀⠁⠺⠁⠽⠀⠾⠀⠎⠁⠽⠬⠀⠞⠀⠩⠊⠞⠀⠞⠕⠀⠍⠑⠀⠕⠧⠻⠀⠮⠀⠠⠔⠞⠻⠝⠑⠞⠦⠀⠠⠹⠔⠅⠀⠁⠛⠂⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠻⠲⠀⠠⠵⠀⠺⠑⠀⠎⠏⠑⠁⠅⠀⠠⠊⠀⠁⠍⠀⠉⠕⠝⠞⠁⠉⠞⠬⠀⠍⠽⠀⠎⠑⠉⠗⠑⠞⠀⠝⠑⠞⠐⠺⠀⠷⠀⠎⠏⠊⠑⠎⠀⠁⠉⠗⠀⠮⠀⠠⠠⠥⠎⠁⠀⠯⠀⠽⠗⠀⠠⠠⠊⠏⠀⠊⠎⠀⠃⠑⠬⠀⠞⠗⠁⠉⠫⠀⠐⠗⠀⠝⠪⠀⠎⠀⠽⠀⠃⠑⠞⠞⠻⠀⠏⠗⠑⠏⠜⠑⠀⠿⠀⠮⠀⠌⠕⠗⠍⠂⠀⠍⠁⠶⠕⠞⠲⠀⠠⠮⠀⠌⠕⠗⠍⠀⠞⠀⠺⠊⠏⠑⠎⠀⠳⠀⠮⠀⠏⠁⠮⠞⠊⠉⠀⠇⠇⠀⠹⠬⠀⠽⠀⠉⠁⠇⠇⠀⠽⠗⠀⠇⠊⠋⠑⠲⠀⠠⠽⠳⠠⠴⠗⠑⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠬⠀⠙⠑⠁⠙⠂⠀⠅⠊⠙⠲⠀⠠⠊⠀⠉⠀⠆⠀⠁⠝⠽⠺⠐⠓⠂⠀⠁⠝⠽⠐⠞⠂⠀⠯⠀⠠⠊⠀⠉⠀⠅⠊⠇⠇⠀⠽⠀⠔⠀⠕⠧⠻⠀⠎⠑⠧⠑⠝⠀⠓⠥⠝⠙⠗⠫⠀⠺⠁⠽⠎⠂⠀⠯⠀⠹⠁⠞⠠⠴⠎⠀⠚⠀⠾⠀⠍⠽⠀⠃⠜⠑⠀⠓⠯⠎⠲⠀⠠⠝⠀⠕⠝⠇⠽⠀⠁⠍⠀⠠⠊⠀⠑⠭⠞⠢⠎⠊⠧⠑⠇⠽⠀⠞⠗⠁⠔⠫⠀⠔⠀⠥⠝⠜⠍⠫⠀⠉⠕⠍⠃⠁⠞⠂⠀⠃⠀⠠⠊⠀⠓⠀⠁⠒⠑⠎⠎⠀⠞⠕⠀⠮⠀⠑⠝⠞⠊⠗⠑⠀⠜⠎⠑⠝⠁⠇⠀⠷⠀⠮⠀⠠⠥⠝⠊⠞⠫⠀⠠⠌⠁⠞⠑⠎⠀⠠⠍⠜⠔⠑⠀⠠⠉⠕⠗⠏⠎⠀⠯⠀⠠⠊⠀⠺⠀⠥⠎⠑⠀⠭⠀⠞⠕⠀⠭⠎⠀⠋⠥⠇⠇⠀⠑⠭⠞⠑⠝⠞⠀⠞⠕⠀⠺⠊⠏⠑⠀⠽⠗⠀⠍⠊⠎⠻⠁⠃⠇⠑⠀⠁⠎⠎⠀⠷⠋⠀⠮⠀⠋⠁⠉⠑⠀⠷⠀⠮⠀⠉⠕⠝⠞⠔⠑⠝⠞⠂⠀⠽⠀⠇⠇⠀⠩⠊⠞⠲⠀⠠⠊⠋⠀⠕⠝⠇⠽⠀⠽⠀⠉⠙⠀⠓⠀⠐⠅⠝⠀⠱⠁⠞⠀⠥⠝⠓⠕⠇⠽⠀⠗⠑⠞⠗⠊⠃⠥⠰⠝⠀⠽⠗⠀⠇⠇⠀⠨⠦⠉⠇⠐⠑⠨⠴⠀⠉⠕⠍⠰⠞⠀⠴⠀⠁⠃⠀⠞⠕⠀⠃⠗⠬⠀⠙⠪⠝⠀⠘⠥⠀⠽⠂⠀⠍⠁⠽⠃⠑⠀⠽⠀⠺⠙⠀⠓⠀⠓⠑⠇⠙⠀⠽⠗⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠬⠀⠞⠕⠝⠛⠥⠑⠲⠀⠠⠃⠀⠽⠀⠉⠳⠇⠙⠝⠠⠴⠞⠂⠀⠽⠀⠙⠊⠙⠝⠠⠴⠞⠂⠀⠯⠀⠝⠪⠀⠽⠳⠠⠴⠗⠑⠀⠏⠁⠽⠬⠀⠮⠀⠏⠗⠊⠉⠑⠂⠀⠽⠀⠛⠕⠙⠙⠁⠍⠝⠀⠊⠙⠊⠕⠞⠲⠀⠠⠊⠀⠺⠀⠩⠊⠞⠀⠋⠥⠗⠽⠀⠁⠇⠇⠀⠕⠧⠻⠀⠽⠀⠯⠀⠽⠀⠺⠀⠙⠗⠪⠝⠀⠔⠀⠭⠲⠀⠠⠽⠳⠠⠴⠗⠑⠀⠋⠥⠉⠅⠬⠀⠙⠑⠁⠙⠂⠀⠅⠊⠙⠙⠕⠲No one is ever sarcastic on the internet, silly. Everyone is serious one-hundred percent of the time. Sarcasm is just a fallacy created to stop the spread of totally true information. You know that "/s" you see on comments that supposedly means sarcasm? That is actually a symbol meaning the person is serious. Everyone just pretends it means the comment is sarcastic, so that they aren't silenced for spreading the truth.Guys I really wanted to believe that Virginia Western was not the cesspool of morons all my fellow biology faculty told me it would be. Unfortunately your finals, which I purposely made as easy as humanly possible, tanked harder than a Kardashian marriage. I personally apologise for expecting the bare minimum from you as students. If you look at your grade book you will notice that you all have gotten a 50 point grade bump as 'extra credit' and no this was not because any of you deserved it but it was infact so I don't get my ass fired when the dean asks me 'hey why the fuck did 50% of your class fail an introductory biology class' to whom I will reply 'hmm I don't know maybe its because these klingons are 18 years old and still giggle every time I say the term 'phagocytosis'. I'd like to add that in fact one of you got a 5/100 on this exam for which I salute you. Considering this was 100% multiple choice and the statistical probability of you missing more than 90% GUESSING is actually higher than your chances of getting laid, which for this student would be an act of God (please stay out of the gene pool you know who you are). I could have actually taken a shit on the scantron, wiped it off on the grass, and I am pretty certain my feces could have picked up more correct answers than you deliberately bubbled in. So congratulations, on making me lose faith in the public school system, and in humanity.卂乃匚刀乇下厶卄工丁长乚从𠘨口尸㔿尺丂丅凵リ山乂丫乙Enjoy

I'm 14. My school started sex-ed, and the teacher presented the class with a thought experiment: "would you rather have a bag of gummy worms or real worms, to eat?" the response of the class, was, of course, logical, in saying gummy worms. The androgynous looking slimy cuck running the class responded by saying that in a south-east Asian culture, the opposite would be true, and this is due to social constructs. He then said gender is the same way. I said that I identify as an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, (dead meme, I know), and un-ironically asked me what my preferred pronouns were. "Propeller and rotor." soon thereafter, I stated that my gender identity had changed to being mayonnaise. He once again un-ironically asked me what my preferred pronouns were. I couldn't take it, and burst out laughing alongside the rest of my like-minded peers. I managed to utter something along the lines of "this is what happens when the ideological pathogen known as liberalism infects western society." We need to win this culture war, pedes.OmO Where do i start? (´ω｀*) hehe~~ last night was the most magical moment because I was watching anime with my little sister and all of a sudden she hugged me!!!!!  (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄) I was sooooo embarrassed !!! &gt;.&lt; She started touching me and said “Onee-chan!! make love with me” (。・_・。)  She started kissing me and she tasted like apples!!! ^w^ It was soooooo nice!!! (≧◡≦) ♡ Then she started stripping and it was super kawaii-desu!!! But the fun ended because papa had to come in and join us (ᗒᗣᗕ)՞ As you all know our God himself, CummyBot2000 has gone missing, to much dismay. While many believe that he is being repaired, I disagree. THE FILTHY MODS DID THIS. THEY TOOK DOWN CUMMYBOT 2000 IN ORDER TO SILENCE US AND IT'S WORKING. BUT NOT ANY MORE MY COMRADES. TODAY STARTS THE ATTACK ON THE MODS. HERE IS THE PLAN: YOU WILL ALL BE DIVIDED INTO SEVRAL REGIMENTS, TO BE MORE ORGANISED. FIRSTLY, THE ANTI-AUTOMOD REGIMENT WILL FIND THE TRIGGER WORDS FOR THE FILTHY AUTOMOD AND SPAM THEM UNTIL THE LITTLE CUCK SHUTS DOWN. SECONDLY, THE FRONT LINE REGIMENT WILL ATTACK THE MODS BY BREAKING RULES AND SPAMMING THEIR PENIS SIZE TO THEM. AND FINALLY, THE LAST REGIMENT WILL BRING THIS BATTLE TO THE BOTSRIGHTS AND DANKMEMES SUBREDDITS AND RALLY OUR ALLIES. TODAY BEGINS THE THIRD GREAT MEME WAR AGAINST THE FILTHY MODS. WE. NEED. COMMUNISM. AND WE WILL GET IT. THANK YOU FOR READING. Don't quote me on this, but Jack Sparrow could of said harambe is my friend you moron ayy lmao thanks Obama Hey guys, my laptop's power bar, the thing that plugs into the wall, well it kinda started making a really wierd chirping sound.

**This is the original.**

>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little shit? Ill have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Ive been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Im the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thats just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldnt, you didnt, and now youre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youre fucking dead, kiddo.


Which came from OperatorChan's copypasta board back in 2010. OP made a thread recently remarking on how [today was the happiest day of his life](http://www.operatorchan.org/pasta/res/116.html) because they made the pasta about 2 years ago. Here is a link to one of the earliest uses from 4chan's /jp/ board [(now archived)](http://archive.foolz.us/jp/thread/6434587/#6434753). The subsequent reply confirms the [source.](http://archive.foolz.us/jp/thread/6434587/#6434828) There is also another aside comment on how the pasta wouldn't go anywhere because [it was way too long.](http://archive.foolz.us/jp/thread/6434587/#6434809) It was later posted on other boards and quickly picked up steam from there. 

It is believed that the ancestor to this pasta seems to be [this one](http://archive.foolz.us/a/thread/23140065/#23140664) which was posted on /a/ around 2009, a year before this version took off. Other posts from the archive confirm [the dates.](http://archive.foolz.us/_/search/boards/a.co.jp.m.q.sp.tg.tv.v.vg.wsg/text/gorilla%20warfare/start/2008-01-01/end/2009-12-30/) (NSFW)

I'll be posting the variations via comments. Feel free to contribute if you have any that I'm missing. Some of them have Unknown on them. If you know what version or perspective they are from, please comment.

I will continue to update this thread if I come across more Sort by new to see the newest additions.On this day, 4/20, I would like to pay tribute to someone who blazed it up on a mass scale like no other person. 

Happy birthday Adolf. <3So today in Spanish class, my teacher told us that we would be listening to a song in Spanish. Already, I began to tremble. I had a bad feeling about this. “Which one?” I ask shakily, not wanting to hear the answer. “Despacito” She responds. I begin to hyperventilate. My worst fears have been realized. I fade in and out of conciseness. I clamp my palms over my ears, but I know it’s futile. The song plays. I’m crying now, praying. God, Allah, Buddha please help me. I curl up on the floor. There’s nothing I can do now. And then it happens. The chorus plays. The girls in my class open their mouths. The screams of the damned, the shrieks of the tortured fill my ears and bounce around my skull. My eardrums rupture, blood leaking out. I try to scream, but no sound comes out. I can only sit there, violently shaking as it happens to me. After what seems like hours, it’s finally over. I try to move, but I cannot make myself. My brain shuts down as my vision fades to black. I muster the last of my energy, uttering the accursed word.

Little did they know I am a 12 year old boy. At first we just played roblox together, but we worked up to more. I even skyped dressed as a hot and sexy "with poor connection" so the video would blur. After many seductive photos of my ass in my sisters underwear I convinced him I was the real deal. It took me 3 weeks to become his girlfriend.

Eventually I scammed this man out of $600 because I convinced him I would come visit if he paid for the flight. I was lucky it paid off because i had spent nearly $200 on make up and many hours of my roblox time watching makeup tutorials to pull off this epic con. He also gifted me over 500 robux.

11/10 would do again. It was actually a nice weekend when I flew to visit him and didn't even mind sucking someone's cock for the first time. We're looking to move in together in October.🧑🏿❤👩🏼

So sad love story can we get a like 😎We should all be ashamed of ourselves! 

This is probably why he left us... 




Can I please get an F in the chat for our tasty boy Cummy? the world we live in. 
it's so... 
wonderous. 
mysterious. 
even magical.
no... 
no no no.. 
not that world.
i meant
this one.
the smartphone.
each system and program app is it's own little planet of perfect.
technology.
all providing services so necessary, so crucial, so unbelievably profound.
look who just sent me a text!
addie mccallister? it must be a mistake. or a joke. or a scam! don't send her your social security number.
she's right there!
that's our user, alex. and, like every freshman in high school, his whole life, everything, revolves around his phone.
and, because the pace of life gets, faster and faster...
phones down in five.
and attention spans get shorter and shorter... and... you're probably not even listening to me right now.
who has the time to type out actual words?
and that's where we come in.
the most important invention in the history of communication!
emo gees.
that's my home!
textopolis.
here, each of us does one thing, and we have to nail it every time.
christmas tree just has to stand there, all festive.
merry christmas!
it's still september, tim!
and princesses...
i am so pretty.
they just gotta wear their crowns and keep their hair comb.
we are so pretty.
devil, poop, thumbs up, they just show up and they're good to go.
but for the faces, the pressure is on.
cryer always has to cry, even if he just won the lottery.
hurray, i'm a millionaire!
laugher's always laughing, even if he's just broken his arm.
ahh!! ah! i can see the bone!! ah ah ah ah ah...
and me, i'm a meh. so i gotta totally be over it all the time, you know? like meh, who cares. which is not as easy as it sounds.
i gotta be mehhhhhhhhh
i GOTTA! be! mehhhhhhhhh
morning misses D, i see you have the little minis with ya!
oh, they're so...
cute!
NYAH, SO ADORABLE, I CAN'T TAKE IT!
I WILL NEVER GET THEM TO SLEEP! STICK TO YOUR ONE FACE, WEIRDO.
OLE! OLE! OH NO! OH NO!
it's hard to only act blasé.
when, living in textopolis is....
just so exciting!
hah low good simeans! those ah some shalp attach shays!
yes, well we have business to attend to.
whot kind off business?
monkey business.
ha ha ha ha, i sounded british.
meh... Oh, that was really good.. meh ? meh ... 
meh ha ha...
what the freak ya doing there, mate?
practicing. today is my first day on the phone.
oh, droit.
i'm gonna be so.. meh. what are you going to do?
blah! me and the boys are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie! woo! puh-zow! gooday, mate!
hey, koh knee chee wah!
sorry emote icons!!
oh, I hate knocking over the elderly.. let me help, let me help...
oh, my colon!!!
ducks... hey, is that the time?
HEY, my eyes are up here, pal!
woo ooh hoo!
woo hoo! right on time!
and last week, Alex sent me next to THIS text!
huh? huh?
HA HA HA THAT ELEPHANT PISSED HIMSELF HA HA HA
AH HAH HA HAH HAH UH HUH HUH
why are YOU laughing, freak? ho ho ha ha ha!
now, unlike me, my parents are total pros.
gene, please tell me you weren't laughing just now. gene so help me i swear
oh, he was, I remember.
let's go see if you can get it right.
i have some bad news, gene, and i'm afraid that you'll have the wrong reaction.
ok, what's the wrong reaction?
anything other than meh.
come on! i don't want to be late!
i'm not letting you go to work today.
wait, WHAT?
you're just not ready, son.
come on!! working in a cube is an Emoji's whole purpose in life!
everybody my age is working on the phone except for me!
oh sweetie, that's not true.
ow!
YEAH! i'm going to work on the phone and I'm only ten!
that's because I believe in you!
should we wash our hands?
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! we're number two! we're number two!
see?
i, i know i'm different, ok?
but, i need to...
i can be meh...
i just... want to be a working emoji, you know, like... everybody else... and then... i would finally fit in, you know?
ah, you fit in, honey.
no I don't, mom. I never have.
but I could change all that if you just let me! just give me a chance!
but what if you get sent out on the phone, making the wrong face?
no dad, i'll make the right face! look!
maaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah?
you're so handsome when you make that face. i think he's ready, mel.
meh.
come on, dad. let me prove it to you.
if you really think you're ready...
YES! yes i am! i promise i won't let you down!
wow!
Congratulations, everyone!
What an exciting day for all of you!
oh, it's really her! oh, pizza!
first day on the job, hi, hi! don't be nervous! i won't bite!
hi, i'm smiler! ho ho ho ho ho... DON'T TOUCH ME!
Hi! i mean.. hey..
as you know, i'm smiler,  i'm the system supervisor here, because I was the original emoji.
here's how it works. it's nothing fancy!
wait a minute... it's really fancy!
you each have your own cube on the emoji bar! if alex chooses you, should you be so lucky, your cube will light up!
it's showtime!
the scanner will scan you, and that scan will get sent right up to alex's text box.
and let me tell you guys, there is nothing like getting scanned for the first time.
a har, you're gonna love it.
now over here is the favorites section, where you'll find all the most popular emo gees.
and of course, you'll find my cube here.
whoo.
you are smooth.
just doing my duty.
ha ha ha! what did i say?
come on, tell me you aren't just a little bit tempted?
steven, for the last time, i don't want to buy a timeshare.
come on, man, it's high five! you know me! i'm a favorite!
Alex hasn't picked you in weeks. when he stops picking you, you're no longer a favorite.
there's gotta be some sort of mistake, i mean, look at me, i'm an attractive, hand-giving high five!
oh! fistbump! come on in!
hey, ladies!
FISTBUMP? he's a knucklehead! literally! look at him, I can look like that! 
ugh, ow, cramp.. big mistake..
oh... help me.. help up a hand..
oh... here you go...
thanks mate... hey, little man, how about you create a distraction, and i'll just slip under the rope!
uh, oh, is someone lost? 
smiler, hiya, just leaving. yeah, you know, just killing time before i go back to my cube in the far corner where Alex can't even See Me ANYMORE!
you may not be a favorite anymore, but you will always have a place, in a cube!
yeah, in the nosebleeds...
uh, i'm standing right here? words hurt.
the most important thing I can tell you is to just be yourself... basically, happy itself...
i am always smiling...
places, please!
emo gees to your cubes!
attention, we've got incoming!
gotta be meh, gotta be meh.
oh my gosh, my own cube!
i can't believe it... oh, i could put a plant over here,  and over here could go an inspirational calendar, okay, gotta be meh...
look at our son get on there, i'm beaming... with pride!
you don't think he'll actually get picked, do you?
heiroglyphics. heiroglyphics was an ancient language of picture forms.
does that remind anyone of anything.
hello.
a language of pictures... anyone?
early heiroglyphics back in ancient...
i gotta reply to addie's text! what should i write?
nothing!
nothing?
words aren't cool.
ok, be cool, be cool...
alright, alex is not sure how he wants to play this...
oh! i would really love it to be me!
beam me up! beam me up!
i need thumbs up on standby!
oh yeah! thumbs up is going in!
wait! alex is changing his mind!
he's moving!
ok, looks like it's gonna be meh...
i'm so nervous, i could almost shrug.
we are go for meh!
initiating scan!
okay, you can do this.
ah! i can't do this! i can't do it!
stop the scan!
i can't, it's too late!
oh!
what's he doing?
he's making the wrong face!
good for him, little... wait, what?
ugh.
abort, abort!
oh, shi...
shut it down, shut it down!
ah!
what is that emoji?
all the emo gees present, evacuate the cube!
evacuate the cube!
i gotta get out of here!
i'm trying!
oh, jeez.
sorry, everybody. that is not what i meant to do!
i kinda.. i kinda panicked..
are you even a meh at all?
uh, who, me?
like you are, is a malfunction!
a malfunction? no, i can be meh, just give me one more chance?
you know what would be really fun? a board meeting, where we can find out what to do with you!
i just wanted to be useful, you know, fit in!
now everybody's calling me a malfunction.
i am a malfunction.
even if you are a malfunction, gene, your mom and dad still love ya.
i knew you weren't ready. let's get you out of here and take you home.
one day, all of this will blow over, and everyone will almost forget about what you did. until then, you should probably stay locked up in the apartment.
wait, you're gonna hide me away? you're embarrased of me.
it's for your own safety. we're trying to protect you, son.
gene, where are you going?
i'm not going to run away from this.
i'm an emoji, and, even though i'm not exactly sure which one...
i've gotta have some sort of purpose here, i know it.
gene, no!
sweetie, please!
so, how'd it go, gavel?
hey, lightbulb, tell me what's going on in there.
what... poop... what is it? tell me turd, tell me truth.
what happened?
i know it was an accident. we all have accidents 
you're so soft, poop.
not too soft, i hope.
i came up here to defend myself, but, uh, you seem pretty happy.
so, good news?
i'm always happy.
oh, right, yeah, truth.
but the only thing that could ever make me unhappy, is if one of our emo gees has made a mistake.
which would cause alex to lose faith in the phone...
and then, our whole gets wiped out!
smiler, i devil pinky swear promise to you that i will never, ever make a mistake in the cube again.
oh, we know you won't, gene. we know you won't!
ha ha, you know, the first time you said it it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it, and, and then, now it's weird.
we're setting you up! with our best anti virus bots!
so they'll, like, uh, they'll just, they're gonna fix me?
actually, delete you. but yes!
wait, what?
if you get deleted, you don't have to worry about department heads, or the future, or lying about being a malfunction!
because you're deleted, right? right! good job! bots!
no!
stop, he's escaped!
party time!
oh, wait a minute...
the air is better here!
beer, tea...
i'm coffee!
sorry... ish... so ish e.
my old cube!
ugh, pinkeye.
mike!
my name's not mike...
ah! there's AV bots coming!
what, me? just because i'm in the wrong section?
holy toledo!
what do we do?
quick! this way!
let's go!
don't tell anyone you're about to see this.
they'll never find us down here.
where are we? the basement?
nope. welcome to the loser lounge, where the emo gees who never get used, hang out.
go fish! fishcake with swirls
sweep so you won't cry. sweep so you won't cry. sweep so you won't cry.
i almost got deleted! me! high five!
hey, what's up high five?
they weren't trying to delete you, they were trying to delete me.
you? what's so important about you that they'd send out an entire team of bots?
they say... i'm a malfunction.
gasp
oh, you bringing malfunctions in here now, high five?
for crying out loud, abandoned luggage, that had better not be my leftover chinese food...
uh... what chinese food?
huh ha!
do you have any idea what it's like to be living large? hashtag blessed? the favorite of the favorites, and then demoted to this pit of despair?
here, will you hit my callouses for me?
at least you're a working emoji, that's all i ever wanted.
well, if that's all it will take you to be satisfied, then just find a hacker and get reprogrammed. it's not that complicated.
where would i find a hacker?
in the piracy app, duh.
ugh.
and who took my clear nail polish?
piracy app? to get there, i mean, i have to leave textopolis.
so? i've done it. would you be a brother.
one of the princess emo gees left the phone altogether, now she lives on the cloud...
mmm... ooh, that is good. i'm sure the hacker that helped her do that could easily reprogram you.
The name's jailbreak.
jailbreak? that's great? reprogrammed. i just need to get reprogrammed, and then i can finally be the meh i was meh to be!
help me find that hacker high five, will you? please? maybe this hacker can help you, too? like, rewrite some code? get you into the favorites sections?
wait a minute! ow. i've been trying to use my charisma and sensitive entitlement to get me back on top when all I need is a hacker!
today's your lucky day! let's roll!
hey, can i come too?
talk to the hand, bretheren.
i thought i was...
bye, felicia.
ciao, fishcake with swirls. daddy's headed back to the VIPs where he belongs!
wait, what about the bots?
good point, good point.
ow, ow ow, ow... hey...
i shouldn't have picked the cactus. i shouldn't have picked it.
you didn't even try to get the tree, it's baffling.
let's go.
high five? hello?
high five!
where are you?
i'm right here!
here we are! end of the text aisle.
no way.
come on, gene, it's perfectly safe!
ah! gene, help me!
high five! oh no, this is all my fault, high five, I...
i'm just messing with you! it's just one of those rubber finger monster puppets from the eighties, i collected the whole set!
alright, you coming?
uh, what do i do?
what do you mean? just take a step through the other side.
this, is it. the next time i come back here, i'll be a real meh.
high five?
woah!
are you finished?
where, where are we?
welcome... to the wallpaper!
wow. this place is incredible!
each app is a whole new world. 
ow, that's my face, get off my face, thank you.
what is this place?
WeChat!
it's like a whole other world!
oh, it is.
what are they?
they're bubble pups, they might be cute, but man, are they clean.
bubble pups?
they're stickers, gene, try to get with the program?
this is so cool! wait, what's in that one!
everybody's talking about themselves! how does he know so many people?
none of these people know him, but they like him, and that's what matters in this life, popularity.
uh, i, i think i'd rather just have a real friend.
a real friend? how's that going to get you anywhere? what you need are fans! they give you complete and unrelenting support! as long as you're on top.
poor gene, i blame myself.
i blame you, too.
i just wanted to be supported.
you just wanted a vacation.
you take that back, mel.
bots, they haven't found gene by now. he must have skipped town.
you mean the wallpaper?
our boy's on the run.
how about we find him ourselves?
yeah, sure.
tell those bots to follow those mehs.
i'm sure they'll know about all those freaky deaky apps Gene would hide out in.
i'm really good at making plans, you guys, right?
here we are, the piracy app! this is where we'll find jailbreak.
um, but this is, the dictionary app.
that's just what alex wants his parents to think. this is called a skin.
really? what could a teenage boy possibly want to hide from his parents?
just try to keep up, this place can get a little rough.
ahoy mateys, look who's back! high five! i'm a bit of a celebrity here, always welcome. ow!
loser!
come on, follow me.
oh, great, emo gees! i thought the conversation just got dumber.
ugh, internet trolls, just ignore them. eventually, they'll get a job, or a girlfriend, or some sort of purpose in life, and then they'll stop.
virus, we'll just, we'll just walk over this way...
hi! it's so great to see you again!
do i know you?
it's spam! just sign here and i can get you special discounts on vitamins and coupon offers that can save you up to 25 percent!
25 percent?
nonono no no, don't get sucked in!
back off, spam! it's the only way to do it. back off!
thank you very much!
you can illegally download our CD right here!
hey, trojan horse, how are you?
yeah, what'll it be had?
i'll have a bottle of... hack, daniels, hmm? maybe with a plate of... cheese, and hackers, kapeesh?
you try to buy a hacker, you can just ask, you know.
oh, sorry, um, yes. we're looking for a hacker named jailbreak.
oh, i know a guy who could hook you up.
right over there.
oh, yes. patable.
no, not him. her!
wait, he's a she?
hey! jailbreak! mind if we join in?
yes.
that's the thing about the internet, is that you never know if someone's being ironic or sincere.
i sincerely, unironically want you to go away.
ha ha ha ha, so good...
so here's the thing, my friend gene here has a little problem.
well, see, i'm supposed to be a meh, but i don't really feel...
yeah, yeah, and we thought that you could help...
the princess, you know, off the phone...
woah, hold up, that's not a meh face.
bots, they're after me!
how are you doing that?
look, it's just something that i can do, can you help us?
follow me.
bots, delete my history!
i need to wipe my entire hard drive!
i made the most delicious cinnamon buns!
maybe if there was something to uh, jog my memory?
come on! move!
hey trolls, wipe our mailbox wearing a tuxedo!
hi, it's so great to see you again!
this tunnel will get us out of here! move!
get us out of here! move!
did that cloud taste sweet to you?
ow.
ow.
ow.
help me. help, i'm stuck!
sweet motherboard!
where am i?
candy crush!
get me out of here!
hey, cornface! try getting him out the top!
already on it! hold tight, gene!
woah!
woah!
this feels very off.. and smells. i mean, it smells delicious, but, i still don't like it!
the game obviously thinks you're a candy, even though you're, weirdly misshapen, you know?
what do i do?
stay very still! don't worry, we've got your back! right, high five?
hey, fingers! you wanna focus?
for your information, i happen to have a sugar addiction, and it's a very, serious...
hey, finger head, we have to get Gene out of the game without blowing him up!
i don't want to blow up!
we have to match up the candies so that Gene will drop to the bottom. 
and we can't match him with any yellows, or else...
oh! don't do that, please don't do that.
watch. got it?
knock 3 in a row, don't blow gene up, got it.
and, we have to be careful.
yeah yeah yeah. careful!
woo hoo! candy!
yo! no no no! don't do yellow! do NOT do the yellow!
i said careful!
hey, addie! i... i was just wondering, if, you are...
tasty.
what?
um...
delicious.
excuse me?
sweet.
hey addie!
uh... hi nikki.
see you later, alex
sugar crush.
ah! i'm so over this.
Wireless Repair Service, how may I help you?
i'd like to make an appointment. it's like this phone is playing games with me!
woah! hey, what does this do?
get me out of here!
ooh... suck it in... stop it... stop it... ow ow ow...
it's not working!
well, there's one option left. we line you up with the yellows.
but you said not to do that!
special candies get transported to that jar. the game might think that you're a special candy.
and... what if it doesn't think i'm a special candy?
well...
ah!
jailbreak, hello? hello, jailbreak?
uh, sorry.
what if it doesn't think i'm a special candy?
oh, i'm not too worried about it.
alright, just do it.
gene, gene!
you're alive!
you were trying to see if i had somehow turned into candy, weren't you?
yes i was. and you have not!
hey, looks like something popped up on alex's calender.
ah, i'm sure it's nothing.
uh, alex made an appointment at the phone store?
calm down, everyone, calm down.
don't worry, everything is fine.
maybe alex just wants to buy some accessories.
uh, his appointment is with techinical support.
well, i'm sure we'll have plenty of time to figure this out.
uh, his appointment is for tomorrow.
then maybe it's just for some routine maintenance?
uh, actually, it's to erase the phone.
listen, gene, i'm about to become your knight in shining armor.
you are?
oh yeah.
but first, we need to get uploaded to the cloud. that's where we'll find the source code to reprogram you.
the... cloud? isn't that off the phone?
ding dingding ding! you got it!
mmhm, yeah, the cloud! off the phone! uh!
we're in candy crush, oz, i know a shortcut to just dance, which is right next to dropbox, where we can get uploaded to the cloud.
mmhm, of course, just go dive into the dropbox and vroom!
hold up, here's the stinker. before they let us into the cloud, we have to get past this... firewall.
the firewall uses face identification.
it's really annoying, because i've already tried to get through. guessed wrong once, and now i'm locked out for life.
locked out for life?
you're thinking, because i can make different faces, the firewall will think i'm different emo gees!
yeah, i wanted to say it, because it was my idea.
you know, women are always coming up with stuff that men are taking credit for.
you know what, well, let's hit the road.
high five, you coming?
i'm coming!
why do i always think i'm going to come around on black licorice? ah!
oh! my precious...
move it!
sudden death, here we come!
let's try this one...
you tube?
wow, what an original treat, and i don't even need a remote.
that guy is so expressive.
he reminds me of gene.
yes, something's really wrong here.
our son is a malfunction, and you should have never let him go into that cube.
don't blame me for that now, i am hopping mad at you. see?
mary, i think we're being followed, but don't overreact.
uh oh.
i told you not to overreact.
what are you doing now?
i could be in there for hours.
hey, where are you going.
i think we should go our seperate ways, mel.
i thought i knew the meh that i married, but maybe i don't.
but, mary?
this tunnel will help us avoid the bots.
thanks for helping us.
it's really, really nice of you.
NPD, dude. you're helping me!
move along, move it, why so slow?
high five, stop, why are you getting so close? back off.
i can't stop now, i'm having a sugar rush!
i'm going to go around you.
if i stop moving, my heart's going to explode!
coming through, jailbreak! watch out!
hey! watch it, knuckle butt!
i can't feel my face! ha ha!
jailbreak, you said back there that i'm... helping you.
i've been trying to get past that firewall for months!
ha ha ha ha ha, come on, come on, the faster we go, the faster I can become a favorite! ah ha ha ha ha ha!
woo hoo! look at me
i just want to bounce out of here, get off the phone, and live on the cloud!
hee hee! ow! what just happened!
you know, you don't like it here?
there are so many rules here! what is up with that?
the cloud's supposed to be amazing, it's full of dreams too...
oh, sugar crash. i can't hold on anymore. catch me, gene, catch me!
and you can be whoever you want!
thanks.
we're free! come on!
oh, oh my gosh, my hands are sweating.
you know what, come to think of it, i don't really remember there ever being a hacker emoji.
oh, um, you know, you're taking too much of my brain space, let's try to keep the chit chat to a minimum.
ooh, someone likes you.
what are you talking about?
this just like when peace sign gave me just one finger, i knew she was in love with me.
let's go!
ugh, i'm never eating another piece of candy ever again...
high-five, don't do it!
don't you do it!
it's already been in there once.
don't do it.
wow.
move it!
are my fingers getting fat? i'll tell you what, this bandage wasn't so tight before.
okay, we get through this app, and dropbox is right on the other side.
we just need to keep it super DL in here. and no matter what, we can't, turn it, on.
OMG this turned it on!
what? i'm a hand, it's a big red button!
woah.
no no no no!
what's happening!
welcome to just dance!
follow my moves and you get to move forward!
do the wrong moves and you get an X!
three strikes and you're out!
out? what does she mean by out?
digital death. thanks to you, fingers, now we're going to have to dance our way out.
which is alright with me, because I can shake it like michael. or michael's glove, anyway.
Are you ready to daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnccccccee?
this is bad, gene, i can't dance, i got no groove!
come on, everybody can dance!
not me, okay? i'm really stiff... see? you don't... understand?
okay, no no.
stop, stop. you have to stop.
i see now what you are saying?
just follow her moves.
ready to dance in three!
this i can't do!
two!
dude! just shut up and...
dance!
i'm just doing it! hee hee! shamon!
jailbreak! i got you! look, just do the music, express yourself!
dance?
yeah, you got it! now throw some sauce on that dance burrito!
woo hoo! i'm doing it! i'm finally nailing this dance!
you got it!
hee hee!
oh ho ho! great job! now you're moving on to free dance!
impress us with your moves to move forward!
more dancing?
you're killing it, gene!
nice! take it gene! you can break it!
wait a minute! i've never seen that dance before! what's it called?
the emoji... bob?
i love it!
you do!
everybody! do the emojiiiiiiiiiii bob!
ha ha ha! woo!
oh! princess!
woah! you're the princess emoji!
you never got off the phone!
new player!
who?
oh no!
we gotta go!
no worry, they're robots, they can't dance!
downloading thought protocol...
can't dance, he says. heh.
hey alex, you gonna dance for us?
alex, that's extra homework for you.
yeah, alex's getting wicked, ha ha ha...
alex must be deleting the app!
watch out!
we gotta get out of here! come on!
hoo! this song is my jam!
high five! come on! let's go!
hurry!
gene! i got you!
gene!
gene...
hey, wait a minute, where's high five?
alex trashed the app.. and high five right along with it.
wait, what? wait, trashed? high five is in the trash?
he wanted to dance... but, i knew it was a bad idea... 
i'm so sorry... we gotta get him out of there.
gene, dropbox is right here, we have to get to the cloud!
and the trash is on the other side of the phone! we don't know how many other bots are out there! i'm sorry!
no, wait! i can't go without high five. i don't care how far away it is.
gene...
that's my friend down there. i'm not going to just let him get deleted.
what, what is it?
i've always just thought, you've got to look out for number one...
but what good is it to be number one, if there aren't any other numbers?
wow, okay.
i'm sorry, this is, this is my malfunction, i just, i can't be meh about anything, this is why i'm going to be reprogrammed.
well, actually, it's kinda cool.
wait, really?
no, i think i know a shortcut. we can take the music streams in spotify. let's go give that big hand a hand.
come on!
now it's trashed the just dance app, and our bots are offline, and it's giving me a real headache...
i am so angry! i really need to stay happy. can we please lighten the mood?
no one can resist la fiesta! ole!
not that happy.
ow!
we've only got four hours before alex's phone appointment. if they find a malfunction on the phone, we are all going to be wiped!
she said wiped!
aim higher, steven.
i didn't want to have to do this, but it is fun to press buttons.
the illegal upgrade!
now that makes me happy! ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
i just want to dance.. dance...
argh! quiet, you saucy gypsy.
ugh, where am i?
hi! it's so great to see you again!
you're in the trash, fingers for brains!
get away from me, troll!
hi! it's so great to see you again!
i've got to get out of here.
you can't! and at the end of the day, the trash gets emptied, and we're all going to die!
oh no, no, no!
this is the last face you will ever see!
this is spotify?
yep, every one of those streams is a different song.
is it safe?
are you sure that this is a good idea?
that's the point of the wave, dude!
can we at least pick a... a colorless stream?
okay buzzkill...
alex, a bunch of people are hitting the promenade, and i think addie might be there, too...
that's perfect! i have an appointment down there, anyway!
i've got to get this phone fixed!
hey, bubble butt!
yeah.
ah, much better.
so, i gotta ask, is it true that when a princess whistles, birds fly down from the skies..
hello, stereotype, that is a complete and total myth!
i'm sorry.
did you realize that in the first emoji set, a woman can either be a princess, or a bride? that's why I need to get to the cloud, where you can be whatever you want to be!
get ready! whale song coming!
wait, wait, whale what?
whale song! from alex's biology DVD!
woah!
wow!
woah!
ha ha ha ha.
you're not going to see that sitting around in a cube.
funny, you went out of the cube, and I went in.
gene, that means you can't be yourself. what's the point?
you know, i think you're pretty cool just the way you are.
we're, we're going to need this.
nobody knows, the touchscreen dramascene. nobody knows my screenshot...
trash? me? i used to be somebody.
here i am, in an old email Alex never sent.
addie, blah blah blah blah blergh...
and then there's me! high five! right there! doing my job!
FYI, nobody cares about you.
just leave me, troll, and let me die!
in this dump alone!
let me look for the world's smallest violin in here, so that you can play it!
is that the hand angel of mercy? has she finally come for me?
give me your hand! i mean, give me yourself!
take my hand, angel! i'm ready to take my place amongst the other great hands of the past.
it's me, gene!
gene?
the one and only.
gene!
i got him!
take me with you!
high five!
let go of me!
you'd leave me down here?
you were wrong, troll, people do care about me!
and i'm not upset, troll! do you see how not upset I am?
gene! you came back for me! you saved me...
it wasn't just me, jailbreak helped, too.
she's a hugger. give her a squeeze.
oh, nonono no. 
not really, nothing great. 
i'm not feeling your feelings, relieve me!
you filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench, and I was once one of you, so I feel your pain.
so now, go. be free!
smooth sailing from here.
huh ha ha!
ugh.
gene! gene...
gene? are you insta gramming?
oh, where is my gene...
oh, mary, you've really done it this time.
no, you haven't.
mel? what are you doing in alex's trip to france album?
i was looking for you. none of this is your fault, mary. it's mine.
what do you mean?
is that a tear on your cheek?
it's my fault gene is the way he is. i have other expressions, too.
i think they've just been buried away.
but with gene going missing, and thinking i might have lost you, too...
oh, mel, why didn't you tell me?
i didn't know myself.
right now, i'm so overwhelmed with passionate feelings for you.
mary, my love for you burns with the intensity of a red hot flame.
oh, i like it.
let's go find our son.
together.
we'll always have paris, mary.
so you're a princess. so you have a little tiara, very fancy. is it true when a princess whistles, birds fly
that's what i said!
no, guys, that's a stupid myth! what awkward virgin haven are you living in? go read an e-book! educate yourself!
uh, jailbreak?
what the?
what is that?
smiley must have upgraded her bots!
let's get out of here before it...
hi, do you remember me, it's smiler! i'm coming to you live from the amphitheater,  why don't you come back to textopolis and we can talk through our differences, okay? my friend here will escort you, alright, i'm gonna see you soon, buddy, bye now!
we're actually going to delete them in front of everyone. 
psst, it's still on.
it's still on? oh! jiminy, attack the frauds!
seperate!
take a look!
jailbreak!
gene! this way!
it's still onto me!
over here!
let's go!
we have to make it to dropbox!
yes!
no!

oh... shaw.
welcome to the firewall, how may I help you?
alright, here goes!
what should I do?

yeah, kind of.

i don't get it! we've tried all of the important things in alex's life!
his favorite pet, his sport, his favorite grandma...
i'm sorry, gene. i let us all down.
now, if I had to come up with a password, I'd probably use the name of a girl I like.
i've been all over the phone! he's never mentioned a girl.
yes he has!
hi. when I was in the trash, I read a very interesting email, but, i'm just a dunce, in the corner, forbidden to speak...
what email?
sorry, what?
what email?
uh, took it out, at school, he was declaring his feelings of love for her, i guess instead of sending it he tossed it in the trash.
high five, this is very important. what is her name?
her name, yes! excellent question. 
it... was... tina. karen. marge. lint, lindsay. ack, allison. sarah, or, lupita. i want to say lupita, but that doesn't feel right, now i'm saying it out loud.
ugh.. gotta find that email, i think i can access the trash. i got it! addie!
yes! yes, that's it, addie! i knew i'd get there!
dear addie, you and I, we are like diamonds in the sky. you're a shooting star I see. a vision, ecstacy.
shining bright like a diamond.
he used a high-five, see?
guess now we know why he trashed it.
ooh, shade.
guys, should we try this?
addie!
access granted. 
oh snap.
this place, is, amazing.
wow, i can't believe it.
woah.
one little emoji could sure get lost in a place like this.
i... i guess we should, make you, a meh before that bot comes back home.
oh, oh, so we're gonna do that now.
we had a deal, right?
yeah, okay. right.
i, uh, guess i'll start hacking.
ha! we did it, gene!
all our dreams are coming true!
i'll be alex's favorite again, and you'll be a real meh!
ha ha, yeah!
do the hand dance. do the hand dance. and pinky. pop it with the pinky. pop it with the pinky.
yeah, but this all seems kinda super fast now, doesn't it?
i didn't expect to be having these feelings right now.
well, maybe you should go and express them while you still can.
so, uh, i've been thinking, um, ever since we.
jailbreak, you're the coolest, most interesting emoji i've ever met. and, after all the adventures that we've had, i'm just not sure that i want all of that to go away.
because, my feelings, right now, are, like, huge. i just think that they could be enough for me to want to stay the way that I am.
if it means that i could stay here, with you, like, forever. forever and ever. and ever. maybe longer than that, even? like in the fairy tales.
uh...
wait, wuh, what is that?
gene, if this is about you deciding not to be meh, then, i am all about that.
i like you just the way you are, but i had a plan.
right.
i'm not just some princess, gene, waiting for my prince.
i mean, uh, what you said was beautiful, but, gene...
ha ha ha! you're all... meh! the source code worked!
turns out I didn't need it.
for the first time in life, meh is all I feel.
oh! gene!
i have an appointment. i'm a little early.
no prob. i can take you right now.
jailbreak! ah!
don't do that!
that freaking huge bot has got gene back inside the phone!
what?
he left being more meh than the meh-est meh face i've seen!
what did you say to him?
it's what I didn't say. we gotta go get him.
how are we going to get there in time before he gets deleted?
ugh.. i can't believe i'm doing this. you tell anyone you saw this and I'll crack more than those knuckles.
woah.
birds do like princesses! it's not a myth! it's not a myth at all!
what happened with becoming a favorite?
because i'd rather have one real friend. let's go get him.
i can't wait to see that emoji's face!
look at that expression!
is that for realizing that you've put all of textopolis at risk?
causing Alex to question our reliability? hmm?
hey, now that's going too far, even for me!
if we could delete this malfunction, before he gets dissapointed, Alex will realize there's nothing wrong with the phone.
and any last words?
meh.
well, it's too late for that.
delete him!
wait!
you delete gene, you'll have to delete me, too.
what?
i have the same malfunction gene has.
dad?
oh gosh, i don't know what to do! yes i do! BOTS!
sorry misses meh.
wow. i did not see that one coming.
smiler, I think you might be making too much stink out of all this.
oh really? how about you're next?
i was wrong, gene. i should have believed in you all along.
oh, what a touching daddy son reunion moment! it reminds me of the time I deleted you both! oh wait! that's this time!
delete the two malfunctions!
How's that for an entroof
gasp
oh, great.
I can't reach!
oh no! what did you do to my beautiful monst  Ow
my tooth!
hand, button!
jailbreak?
oh, gene... you really are a meh...
what happened to looking out for number one?
being number one doesn't matter if there aren't any other numbers.
alex's appointment! he's deleting the phone!
nononono no no no no!
show me alex.
are you sure you want to delete everything?
do it!
red alert!
alex, no!
game over.
fellas, i'm afraid this is the last call.
dude, addie's here.
you should go over.
every time I try, i screwed up!
i don't even know how to tell her how I feel!
if we help alex connect to addie, maybe he won't delete us.
i might be able to bypass the wipe and get a text through to him.
but we'll only have time to send one.
maybe I should go! he has love in his eyes.
send me! alex looks nervous, too!
he's more shy than nervous!
stop! it's gene. he's all of those things!
emo gees should only be one thing!
oh, really?
gasp
the princess!
linda?
not now, mom!
gene, you got this.
that's not me anymore.
but I have to try.
it's starting!
no! it's ending!
almost in?
working on it!
mom? dad? no..
i'm in!
last time I was in this cube I screwed everything up.
gene, why do you think I came back?
it's because of you.
me. 
it's all inside of you, gene. just try to bring it back. and do you.
high five!
i don't want to wave goodbye!
it's now or never, gene!
jailbreak, now!
woah! she got this emoji!
no way!
hey, i got your text!
that's one super cool emoji!
i know, right?
a lot of feelings in one! i get it!
i like that you're one of those guys who actually expresses feelings!
yeah, that's me!
so, do you think you cou yes, i'd love to go to the dance with you.
we made it!
oh, i could have lost you, peter pinky finger... oh, you wretchy ring finger, even you, tiberius thumb...
change your mind?
yeah, maybe it's weird, but i'm going to hold onto it.
gene, you did it! you saved us all!
oh, mel...
gee hee eene! gee hee hee heene!
gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene! gene!
and us! and high five! and high five! and high five! and high five!
hey, what happened, gene? slap me some skin!
and a little orange for the pinky!
hey high five! save a little hand for later! unless you know the hamburger!
back on top of the hand pile!
you're not on the list!
wait, what?
what's going on?
ha! from now on, everyone is welcome!
wait, what is all this?
it's for you, gene!
everybody! the emoji bob!
this is so jazzy...
go eggplant! go eggplant! go eggplant!
we are out of Alex's pocket, emo gees!
this is not a butt dial!
to your cubes!
are we up and running?
roger that.
good, because we got incoming!
looks like it's gonna be gene.
hey gene, ready to try out your new cube?

By instinct I pressed the lock screen button but recently I had bought YouTube Premium so the video kept playing in the background at full volume, much to my horror and despair. I tried unlocking my phone to close the app but my fingers were too moist from my cleaning operation and so I sat there while the man in the video started moaning, my wife finally figuring out that I was gay.

this.A spectwe is haunting Euwope – the spectwe of communyism. Aww the powews of owd Euwope have entewed into a howy awwiance to exowcise this spectwe: Pope and Tsaw, Mettewnyich and Guizot, Fwench Wadicaws and Gewman powice-spies.
Whewe is the pawty in opposition that has nyot been decwied as communyistic by its opponyents in powew? Whewe is the opposition that has nyot huwwed back the bwanding wepwoach of communyism, against the mowe advanced opposition pawties, as weww as against its weactionyawy advewsawies?
Two things wesuwt fwom this fact:
I. Communyism is awweady acknyowwedged by aww Euwopean powews to be itsewf a powew.
II. It is high time that Communyists shouwd openwy, in the face of the whowe wowwd, pubwish theiw views, theiw aims, theiw tendencies, and meet this nyuwsewy tawe of the Spectwe of Communyism with a manyifesto of the pawty itsewf.
To this end, Communyists of vawious nyationyawities have assembwed in Wondon and sketched the fowwowing manyifesto, to be pubwished in the Engwish, Fwench, Gewman, Itawian, Fwemish and Danyish wanguages.
I. Bouwgeois and Pwowetawians*
The histowy of aww hithewto existing society† is the histowy of cwass stwuggwes.
Fweeman and swave, patwician and pwebeian, wowd and sewf, guiwd-mastew‡ and jouwnyeyman, in a wowd, oppwessow and oppwessed, stood in constant opposition to onye anyothew, cawwied on an unyintewwupted, nyow hidden, nyow open fight, a fight that each time ended, eithew in a wevowutionyawy weconstitution of society at wawge, ow in the common wuin of the contending cwasses.
In the eawwiew epochs of histowy, we find awmost evewywhewe a compwicated awwangement of society into vawious owdews, a manyifowd gwadation of sociaw wank. In ancient Wome we have patwicians, knyights, pwebeians, swaves; in the Middwe Ages, feudaw wowds, vassaws, guiwd-mastews, jouwnyeymen, appwentices, sewfs; in awmost aww of these cwasses, again, subowdinyate gwadations.
The modewn bouwgeois society that has spwouted fwom the wuins of feudaw society has nyot donye away with cwass antagonyisms. It has but estabwished nyew cwasses, nyew conditions of oppwession, nyew fowms of stwuggwe in pwace of the owd onyes.
Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle.

Edit: This blew up. RIP my inbox.

Edit2: thanks for the gold kind stranger

I can't even begin to comprehend how mentally challenged you all must be to enjoy the humour on this sub. No this isn't irony or an attempt at "copy pasta" humour. Take a look at yourselves because you're literally at the bottom of society. If a single person on this sub reproduced with another human being I'd be absolutely gobsmacked. And no don't bother copying and pasting this in the comments you fucking freaksI have played Battlefield since BF1942, and I have studied World War 2 since I was 5 years old. I majored in Economics at UCLA with a minor in German Studies, with a heavy focus on the Second World War. To call me “uneducated” because I want a reasonablly authentic game is completely uncalled for. Women DID NOT serve for the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. I am by no means a sexist, but any quick search online of female roles during the Third Reich will reveal that Hitler’s ambition for women was to reproduce as many children as possible, in order to create more “Aryan” people and keep the German military full of new soldiers. Having women on the frontlines was the LAST thing that Hitler and the Nazis wanted. You know what Patrick, maybe YOU are uneducated. Maybe you should do some research on WW2 and realize that the game you are creating is a joke. I call on all of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. We as a community should not be subjected to comments from EA degrading us as uneducated bigots, simply for wanting a game that feels like a World War 2 shooter.

I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know what is gonna come through that door.Yeah, you 👈 read 📘 that 😐 right. 👌 I 👁 can't 🚫 stop 🚫 having 👬 sex 🍆 with 👏 Instant Ramen 🍜 Noodles. 💯 It's 🕛 really 😍 fucked 😩 up 🔺 to 💦 be 🐝 completely 😡 honest, 😇 and 👏 it 💯 all 💯 started 💢 when 🍑 my 👨 boyfriend 👬 suggested we 👥 start 🔘 experimenting a 👌 bit 😁 in 👏 the 👏 bedroom. I 👁 suggested we 👥 try 😐 anal, 🍑 after 👀 all 💯 I’ve 👏 been 👏 hinting lately that 😐 I’ve 👏 been 👏 yearning 😡 for 🍆 him 👴 to 💦 shove 😠 his 💦 seven 🔥 inch 📏 cock 🍆 into 👉 my 👨 tight 👉 bleached 💦 asshole. 🍑 I'd 🙏 be 🐝 such 😳 a 👌 good 👌 anal 🍑 slut 😈 for 🍆 him. 👴 But 🍑 that’s 💪 not 🚫 nearly 👣 what 😦 he 👨 suggested instead.
He wanted 😍 to 💦 face 😀 fuck 🍆 me 😭 while 🕗 I 👁 had 💋 my 👨 mouth 💋 full 🌝 of 💦 Instant Ramen 🍜 noodles.
At first 👆 I 👁 thought 💭 there 👌 was 👏 no 🙅 way 💫 I’d 😗 ever 😠 do 👌 it. 💯 I 👁 yelled in 👏 protest, how 💯 dare he 👨 think 💭 I’d 😗 ever 😠 do 👌 that? 😐 I 👁 mean, 😏 it’s 💀 not 🚫 like 💖 I’m 👌 a 👌 prude, I 👁 fuck 🍆 him 👴 silly 🙃 in 👏 each 👏 and 👏 every 👏 way 💫 he 👨 desires. But 🍑 like 💖 this, 👈 no, 🙅 there’s 💩 no 🙅 way.
That was 👏 until 🙄 he 👨 brought home 🏡 some 👨 Tonkotsu Instant Ramen 🍜 noodles. 💯 He 👨 spent 😵 all 💯 night 🌙 preparing it. 💯 The 👏 noodles 💯 were 👶 cooked 🍳 to 💦 perfection, a 👌 half 💀 marinated egg 🍳 succulently placed in 👏 the 👏 authentic Japanese bowl, 🍀 topped with 👏 seaweed sheets 👉 and 👏 seasoning. It 💯 was 👏 the 👏 perfect 💯 bowl 🍀 of 💦 ramen. 🍜 So 💯 I 👁 sat down 🔻 at 🍆 the 👏 kitchen 🐶 and 👏 started 💢 to 💦 eat. 👉 Fuck 🍆 me 😭 it 💯 was 👏 delicious.
That was 👏 until 🙄 he 👨 started 💢 to 💦 take 👊 off 📴 his 💦 pants. 👖 No! 🙅 I 👁 protested, this 👈 was 👏 way 💫 too 😡 far. 🌌 But 🍑 it 💯 was 👏 too 😡 late, 💤 my 👨 mouth 💋 was 👏 full 🌝 and 👏 his 💦 dick 🍆 was 👏 hard. 🍆 He 👨 proceeded to 💦 slowly 🐌 penetrate 👉 my 👨 mouth. 💋 I 👁 gasped 😫 to 💦 air 💨 but 🍑 all 💯 that 😐 came 💦 in 👏 was 👏 the 👏 taste 👅 of 💦 tonkotsu broth, and 👏 the 👏 faint taste 👅 of 💦 my 👨 boyfriends 👬 eager precum. 💦 I 👁 was 👏 stunned, stuffed 😜 and 👏 starting 😫 to 💦 get 🔟 horny.

The game features three multiplayer modes: "King of the Hill", "Melee", and "Slammageddon". In "King of the Hill", the object of the game is to stay atop of a hill the longest, while opponents try and knock each other off. The first player to reach 30 points wins. The longer the player stay on the hill, the more points she/he receive. In "Melee", the objective is to earn as many slam points within a 2-minute time period. For attack, a word bank that says "Slam" will fill up. Once the bank has filled up, the player can unleash a Slam Attack which can hit multiple opponents. For each opponent who's hit, the player will receive a Slam Point, but if a player get slammed, they'll lose one. The player with the most slam points after the time limit stops wins. In "Slammageddon", each single attack counts as a Slam. But, if a player manage to get a 'Max Slam Juice' potion in Slammageddon match and hit the opponent(s) with your slam, nothing happens. Every character has a "Slam" attack. Slams all have different effects. For example, Shrek's Green Storm attack will send his opponents flying as he undergoes flatulence and Pinocchio's nose extends and he flies towards enemies in an attempt to strike them.Today I found out that my mom is a ｈｅｎｔａｉｓｕ（苛右ゐ）and a lesbian (ｙｕｒｉ).

It does not have a strong taste--some members refer to it as tasting somewhat metallic as though you put a copper penny in your mouth and sucked on it. If your going to do oral on a dog, almost any dog will do, because size isn't important as long as he's willing to let you masturbate and suck him. Just go for it and swallow away.Times had been tough for the entire family. Throughout the war, the rations were decreasing ever so much, to the point of one meal a day at most. There were four in the family; formerly 6, until Grandpa and Grandma passed away a year ago. Though those losses were sad, it was perhaps for the best considering the hellscape that the family was now in. However, trying to explain it to the kids, the youngest being 3-year old Johny, was near impossible. They couldn't seem to grasp why they were eating so little and growing so thin.

 On one fateful night, however, Johny was extremely hungry. He had chosen to sneak into the kitchen to grab whatever he could. He knew his papa would be mad if he found out, but he no longer was able to care. As he tip-toed into the kitchen, trying his best to cause no disruption, he searched the drawers until he found one of the only morsels of food left in the house: sugar. He had grabbed a handful, but to his dismay and his worst nightmare, he heard footsteps. There was no point in trying to run. He knew he was in trouble.

 Papa soon came out of the hallway, exclaiming "Johny, Johny?" The child then responded in as innocent of a manner as his brain could process, "Yes Papa," hoping he had covered his tracks enough by the time Papa had found him. He was able to put away the bowl of sugar in time, however some remained on his tongue, seemingly unable to dissolve. His father sighed, already knowing the truth, but he felt the need to ask anyway. "Eating Sugar?" he said in his calmest voice. It was four-o-clock in the morning, after all. Johny already knew it was too late. He tried to recover as much of his pride as he could, and responded with a firm "No, Papa." Papa, of course, knew that Johny was lying. He knew that he would have to brand Johny again, as unfortunately that was his only method of getting Johny to stop. "Telling lies?!" Papa exclaimed, whilst trying not to wake the rest of the family. He felt that he could turn this into a teaching moment. Perhaps he could teach Johny to no longer lie. "N-n-no, Papa.." the child muttered. Johny knew the punishment. "Open your mouth," Father exclaimed. Johny did, and tried to laugh to lighten the mood. Papa then said, "Well, Johny. You know I don't like to do this, but it's the only way you'll ever learn. Once times get better, I can promise you that you may have as much sugar as you please." Hesitantly, as he knew he had to, Papa pulled out the branding iron. Sobs came from both sides as the iron heated, until it was stamped deep into Johny's skin. The young toddler exclaimed, with tears in his eyes and a flushed, red face, "When will the war end, Papa?"

I'm an Instagram girl's wet dream, and I still turn that shit down since I have better options throwing themselves at me nearly every time I go out in public.The shrine’s been set,

the candle’s aflame.

I summon this bot,

with, “Mods are gay!”

Now look below,

to find the beast.

Downvote it to Hell,

make it’s karma the least!

Spam this all over the sub, together we will destroy the gay automod!i wish i was dead

i wish i was deadI don't see what the big deal is about rape. It's just a dick in your hole for a few minutes. It's nowhere near as bad as murder, cancer, or getting flirty eyes from a fat chick. And really, women can't be raped since the vagina is designed to accommodate cock. Only men can be raped. If a woman is penetrated anally against her will, she's just experiencing male rape, which is an excellent learning experience for her, to discover the struggles that men go through.

We at Americans For Purity hope that you never have to deal with the tragic heartbreak of a child who Masturbates. But the sad fact is, Masturbation is rampant among today's youth. The first step towards dealing with a problem is to recognize that the problem exists. Here are some of the most common warning signs that your child may be Masturbating.

1. Does your teenager have acne? Masturbation often leads to excessive hormone production, which is the cause of acne. Very few teenagers who don't Masturbate have acne.
2. Is your teenager depressed? If a teenager acts sullen, withdrawn or unhappy the most likely cause is Chronic Masturbation.
3. Does your child lock his or her bedroom door? It is not healthy for a teen to want privacy. Chances are he or she is in there Masturbating!
4. Does your child listen to "Rock And Roll" music? If a teenager has rebelled against God far enough to listen to the Devil's music, then he or she has almost certainly rebelled enough to try Masturbation.
5. Are there semen stains on your son's bed sheets or underwear? There's only one way they could have gotten there! Line up all of your sons at least twice a day for a family Prayer Meeting and Underwear Check!
6. Does your teenager have Liberal political opinions? The weakness of mind brought on by Self-Abuse often leads to left-wing sympathies.
7. Does your child wear fashionable clothing or hairstyles? If your child can't resist the peer pressure to look a certain way, he or she probably can't resist the peer pressure to Masturbate, either.
8. Does your child look guilty or deny Masturbating? Very few teenagers will openly admit to Masturbating!
9. Have you caught your child Masturbating? If you walk into your son's bedroom without knocking and he's in there with his pants down holding his erect penis, he's probably Masturbating.

Preventing and Treating Teen Masturbation

If your child Masturbates, there are steps you can take to stop the problem. If your child doesn't Masturbate, there are things you can do to prevent it.
1. Remove your child's bedroom door. Privacy is one of the leading causes of Masturbation.
2. Monitor your family's use of the restroom. Not only will this prevent Masturbation, it will prepare your teens for today's workplace, where corporations are stepping up their surveillance of employees' bathroom usage.
3. Kill your television. There is absolutely nothing of value on television. Everyone should be reading their Bibles or working, not watching filth like Baywatch or Star Trek.
4. Control your child's reading material. Screen everything your child brings into the house. Do not allow anything even remotely stimulating. Get up early in the morning and go through the newspaper cutting out all of the pictures in the Underwear ads. Burn them before your teenager wakes up.
5. Be sensible about the music your child listens to. There is hardly any music in existence that is really suitable, because anything with a "Rock," "Country" or "Gospel" beat to it (even if it is labeled "Christian!") is designed to incite sexual desire and summon demons from the Pit of Hell straight into your nice little Suburban home! (We have documentation on file for those of you who don't believe this.) Practically all music CDs, tapes or MP3 files in your child's possession must be destroyed, especially if they are by pornographic "Rap" artists such as Garth Brooks, Britney Spears or 'NSync. If you collaborate with your fellow Church-goers on this, the event can turn into a huge, festive Bonfire and prayer meeting!
6. Use corporal punishment. Spare the rod and spoil the child! Although outlawed by Socialists in many places, a good, sound thrashing has always been the best cure for the unruly child.
7. Buy and use commercially available Anti-Masturbation devices. You can get one for your Boys by clicking here. President Bush has made it one of the goals of his Faith-Based Initiative to fund private Christian companies to develop an effective anti-Masturbation device for Girls.
8. Understand your child's language. There are dozens of slang terms for Masturbation in use by today's teenagers. You should be familiar with them. Click here for a list. There are many other lists available on the Web. Don't use these slang terms around your children! If you must refer to Masturbation, use the term "Self-Abuse."
9. Scientifically test your children for signs of Masturbation. The same Liberal naysayers who insist we can't build a Missile Shield scoffed until they were bleeding when I revealed that Scientists were hard at work on an aerosol spray that would reveal signs of Masturbation in your children, but it's here! CheckMate scientifically detects a protein Enzyme produced by the male Prostate Gland to reveal traces of semen on clothing, sheets, ceilings, keyboards, etc. It apparently won't detect Masturbation in girls (my Scientific consultants assure me that females have no prostate glands, although the Bible suggests otherwise), but will uncover sexual activity in your daughters by detecting traces of semen in Panties, hair, etc. For additional security, you may easily buy a $10.00 microscope from Toys R Us and a $500.00 centrifuge from Fisher Scientific that will enable you (MALE CHRISTIAN PARENTS ONLY!!!!) to examine your sons' urine for signs of the Sin of Onan. The slightest decline in a boy's Urinary Spermatozoa Count should be met with instant and total humiliation (and hospitalization if possible).
10. Make your daughters grow their fingernails as long as possible. Many Christian parents will measure their daughters' fingernails every week and pay them an allowance based on the combined length. The reason for this is that long fingernails interfere not only with female masturbation, but with Lesbian sexual activity. They will also facilitate the "sniff test" for those of you who use it to monitor your daughter's sexual activities.
11. Put boxing gloves on your children's hands at bedtime. Boxing gloves are pretty hard to take off without someone's help. If you do this you can sleep soundly, knowing that your children aren't touching themselves in an impure way.Think about it. If you fuck a girl, you are touching the dick juices of every guy she has ever been with. Plus, girls like dicks, and everyone knows that's hella gay. So the solution would be to fuck guys instead, right?

Wrong.

If two guys have sex, it is 100% gay since you are fucking a guy who likes getting fucked, which is gay as fuck, making you gay for fucking another gay. Now, if only you had a way to fuck straight guys...

Except you do. See, if you dress up as a chick and convince a straight guy to have sex with you, you'll be having straight sex, with someone who doesn't like dick in the slightest. But for that, you must hide your male side from him at all costs, otherwise you will instantly turn gay.

That's why traps are the only people who aren't gay. Hey 🖐 Leftits 😁

Can you count the genders?🤔

Well, you should be done counting by now 😉

Because there are only two! ♀♂🤣

When you troll a libtard

epic style 😎😎😎Okay, you know what? Im gonna say it.

Horse cock is fucking mediocre. You know why?

Because it lacks complexity. Canine cock has that glorious knot

"But horsecock has a flare!!!!" Yeah and after it cums its soft. Who wants a partner with super short stamina? "But the flare keeps the cum inside you!!!" For what? 15 seconds!? A knot does that too, for much longer, and its in just the right place to press against your prostate/g-spot. So with each one of your lovers heartbeats you can get propelled further into pleasure.

Or what about the luscious curved taper of a dolphin or orca? Thick at the base and the taper makes it an easy adjustment for beginners wroldwide.  Not to mention they're PREHENSILE.

And hows about the barbed feline cock? It takes some getting used to for sure, and its not for everyone. But those barbs can really take you to the next level, the pain mixed in with the pleasure is exquisite.

Look at snakes and sharks! There's two dicks to play with.

Dragons have bumps and ridges, tapered and knotted, and every combination between!!!

Alligators and crocodiles have dicks that are literally ALWAYS erect.

And don't even start on size. Last I checked, sex isn't all about the dick, as a matter of fact you could say the cock is less than half of the important part of sex. 

Horsecock is just glorified, uncomfortable, human cock, with no merits other than size, and thats a pretty fucking weak merit for this lauded "god of all cocks".

[Source \(first time I've seen it anyway\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/comments/8rw7sh/furryirl/e0v0rx8/)Domminate the room, do what i do, get one of those 15L water cooler bottles and bring it to class slung over one shoulder, slam that motherfucker on the ground in the aisle.



Everytime you feel a little thirsty stand up, lift the bottle to your mouth with both arms, make sure you spill plenty of water over yourself and the floor every time you do, also, let out a deep, loud, exhalation of satisfaction after every sip, then finish the routine by slamming the bottle on the ground again before loudly saying, "pfew, I needed that, I was getting a bit THIRSTY" yell thirsty as loud as you can.



When class finishes, pick up the bottle in such a way that the remainder pours out as you leave the room.i was sat at home drinking brain fluid when fred ring

Cold and quiet, the grave marker memorialized the day that Johnny's innocent, happy disposition ceased to brighten the halls of the man's home.

The man clenched his fists, trying in vain to stifle the tidal wave of grief that threatened to erupt. "Telling lies?" he whispered through tears.

The grave marker said nothing. "Jonathan Smith, 1999-2005" was the only reply it could offer, and only if one chose to read it.

The man had no idea that he could become so angry, and he had no idea that little boys could be so... so frail. He didn't comprehend that he was hurting his son till after his hands released their grip around Johnny's throat, till he heard his wife screaming...

"All over a bag of sugar?" the arresting officer had asked. He was a young man with a crew cut, no older than the man's nephew, maybe even a rookie cop, trying to make sense of the tragedy. The man had offered no reply. He could only watch in stunned silence as the paramedics loaded his son's lifeless body into the ambulance...

But now the man realized it wasn't just about sugar. No, it was about *him.* He should have seen the warning signs. He had stopped going to AA, ignoring the phone calls from his sponsor. He had started drinking again, because of course he had, he always came back to the bottle. No matter how much the liquor destroyed his life, no matter how hard he fought for sobriety, he could still hear its silent siren's call, and he *could* resist it, for a time. Only for a time.

So the bottle had found him again, just like it had found him on the day he snuck into his pappys liquor cabinet when he was twelve. And as the man lost himself in the devil's drink, he could only watch helplessly as the relationships he worked so hard to build in sobriety crumbled. The light slowly but surely went out of his life, and, true to form, the Bad Thoughts returned.

It was during one such spell of drinking and Bad Thoughts that the man found Johnny, his son, his only son, sneaking away from the pantry with a mouth full of sugar.

The grave marker stood as a silent witness to these quiet revelations.

The man thought back to the final words he had spoken to his son. "Open your mouth," he whispered to the grave marker. He checked his watch--it had been three hours since he took two bottles of Tylenol. He was past the point of no return. Even if he were rushed to the hospital this very moment, there was nothing the doctors could do. It would be a painful death, and slow. But perhaps this was the best way to atone for his crime.

No longer fighting back tears, the man now struggled to hold back a fit of maniacal laughter. "Ha, ha, haaaa," he whispered. He lay down before the grave marker. He was beginning to feel nauseous and achy. The Tylenol was making short work of his already fragile liver. Soon he would spike a fever and begin bleeding. It would not be long now.

I'm coming to see you, Johnny.

I'm coming to see you soon.I showed the reveal trailer to my Grandad. A man who fought in France. He said...

"Is that a female?"
"Yes grandad"
"Is that face paint?"
"Yes grandad"
"Does she have a prosthetic hand?"
"Yes grandad"

He then took his glasses off as his eyes filled with tears and said...

"I lost so many friends in Europe during that war. They weren't ’friends’ at all. They were my brothers. And I miss them everyday."

He wiped his tears away and finished by saying...

"I'm sorry, I didnt see any women with claws wearing face paint....but I saw a lot of dead men. Is this what people think happened? Because it isnt."

I patted him on the head and simply told him...

"You're uneducated."﻿Minecraft is the reason Gen Z is becoming so redpilled. Here's some fun things to think about:

Steve: A white male ubermensch who conquers nature and carves it into his own dominion. He builds beautiful structures and ingenious redstone technology.
Zombies: Represent the bugman. Slow, stupid, and outnumber Steve by 100 to 1. They have no ulterior motives beyond consumption.
Creepers: Represent muslims. Not only do they blow themselves up but they are also green which is a color strongly associated with Islam.
Enderman: A tall black man who steals shit and can't swim
Villagers: Big nosed merchants who live in the desert and have their hands constantly rubbed together

PARTYING 🎉💃🏻 DRINKING 🍻🍸🍹🍷 MAKING OUT AND SEX 👅💦 O_O PERIODS 🍫 HEARTBREAKS💔☹️ MIDDLE SCHOOL SOPHOMORES (7️⃣TH GRADE)My new boyfriend cannot receive a blowjob like a normal human being Before I begin -- I know this is going to sound like a joke, but please trust that it is real. You can be as skeptical as you want, but I'm the one who has to live out this nightmare.

I [24f] have been dating this new guy [26m] for the past 3 months and it's been going swimmingly. He's charming, funny, not a slob (important), we click, yada yada. The sex is also passionate and usually really good. His head game is on point and I reciprocate often. When giving him a blowjob he is vocal, which can't be said for many guys.

There is only one issue. He has a very "memey" sense of humor, which I generally enjoy. When I'm going down on him, he'll squirm and moan, but will only say variants of

In the past 3 months I have kept mental note of all of these variant interjections. They include but are not limited to

I swear this is all he will say. If you don't believe me, I failed nearly every creative writing class in high school so there is no way I could've come up with all that shit. At first I thought it was the funniest thing on the planet. It's still funny. But it's hard to do my job when I can't stop cracking up. It's getting to the point where I can't really give him oral anymore because I start cackling even before we begin.

I kind of want him to stop because it's getting old, but then he will pull out some new outlandish phrase and grin devilishly as I struggle to pleasure him without choking on my own laughter. It's interfering with our foreplay at this point. We've spoken about it outside of the bedroom and he doesn't seem to take it seriously because I can't confront him about it without breaking down into bouts of laughter. And I kind of don't know if I want it to stop because it's so god damn ridiculous.

Please help me figure out if this is becoming a problem or if I've entered some sort of succ twilight zone that bestows immortality.Why don't you do a 720° turn counterclockwise and suck a 13.9 inch dick while inhaling approximately 193 liters of pure oxygen, causing you to pass out due to an excess of oxygen in the lungs. After that, you will proceed to fall down 1,290,920 flights of stairs, at the end of which is a 3 x 6 x 4 foot hole filled with solid steel spikes with a base of 12 centimeters, a length of 60.96 centimeters, and a side of 3860.1216 centimeters. Finally, when your body hits the spikes, a standard U.S. Army M18A1 Claymore mine will detect your flailing ragdollesque body and proceed to explode, projecting 700 1⁄8-inch steel balls at a velocity of 3,937 ft/s into a 60° fan-shaped pattern that is 6.5 feet high and 50 m wide at a range of 50 m.

Obviously, I’ll still buy a Switch so I can play it and find out. I actually own the Switch already but I’ll buy one that’s just for Smash Bros.

Punxatony PhilSpongebob wake up in his house, puts on his manager name tag, says bye a empty shell

He gets in his car

He drives down his neighborhood to say hello to squidward but the screen only show a house with a "for sale" sign

He stops a gravestone and says "wake up patrick, you been asleep forever" as a tear drops from spongebob's eyes

Finally spongebob arrives at the krusty krab 2 (with the original torn down) he walks to his desk as he looks at a framed picture of him and his friends, his wedding with sandy (with sqwidard and patrick as his best men, pearl as the flower girl and plankton, who's life had been turned around, as the ring bear), and his son's first birthday at goofy goober (with mermaid men and barnacle boy their).

As spongebob drives back home, he gets in a car weack and wakes at the hospital, with his 16 year son holding his hand, praying that he doesn't lose the only living member of his family, 

"Don't worry spongebob Jr., I'll be alright" spongebob says to his son

"I..I don't want you to go, you're the only one that i had left" said spongebob jr. as he starts to cry

"Don't cry, frycooks don't cry" spongebob says as he gives his son his spatula

"But dad, I-i can't be the man that you are, you're the best fry cook in the ocean. I'm no where near as great as you" spongebob Jr. Says, crying

"W...with imagination, you can be anything you wan...want" said spongebob "if a kid like me could get the crown, save the town and Mr. Krabs, if a goofy goober could survive shellcity, get plankton to become my friend, laugh while geting my butt kicked, create the Pretty Patty, helped uncle sqwidard with his band, have the best day ever with the people important to me, including your mother, and speaking if your mother, I'll never forhet my most bestest day, the day I married the best person in the ocean and had you" spongebob says with a smile

Spongebob starts to sing " [In a weak voice] I'm a Goofy Goober, yeah"

Spongebob jr. then join in on the singing (still crying) 

"You're a Goofy Goober, yeah..." They both sing "We're all Goofy Goobers, yeah" spongebob's grip on his sons hand begins to fade "Goofy, goofy, goober, goober, yeah"

Then spongebob starts to flat line

In this state, the disease interferes with the immune system and increases the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis. Given the weakened immune system, many of the patients, such as popular Fortnite streamer Ninja, die on this stage of the Biologically Offset Farkwonian Asintits (BOFA). It is also the last treatable stage. Although not effectrie. there are treatments to LIGMA: LIGMA-BALLS (Bi-Asonurdick Lateral Lactatioustits Sequence) that, even though it's experimental, have shown some promise. With stopping the spread of BOFA at the LIGMA stages, it can stop patients from going into the third and final phase of the BOFA sequence: ETMA, (Entrenched Terminal Mi-Asintits)Cummybot2000 was involved in a drive-by banning by the one and only admins of reddit.com for reasons unknown. The creator of cummybot (or their legal guardian if you will) has stated that cummy was only temporarily suspended for a week which should be over in a day or so by now. So fret not for you can copy paste freely once more. Even if you are a filthy phone poster.

In the meantime there are a couple of accounts who will fill in cummy's job. If you see them in the comments with a pink name please be gentle. For even if they can't fill cummy's large square boots they will certainly try.Bitch if you don't shut your skin tone chicken  bone Google chrome no home flip phone disowned ice cream cone garden gnome extra chromosome metronome dimmadome gnome full blown monochrome student loans Indiana Jones over grown Flintstones x and y hormone friend Sylvester Stallone Sierra Leone auto zone professionally seen silver patrone head ass the fuck upThis is the worst thing I've ever heard in my life. I'm actually sad that music has come to this atonal noise-fest. I'd rather listen to my loved ones be slaughtered with a chainsaw in the next room, than have to horror of this shit. I almost had a brain embolism only 14 seconds in. I hope each and every member of this band dies are horrific, violent fuckin' death for crimes against music.It is a common misbelief that nudity, more particularly, female nudity, automatically gives a film an R rating. Before the introduction of the PG-13 rating in the late 1980s, female breasts were a common appearance in PG rated films. After the introduction of PG-13, it became a more rare occurrence in PG, and became common in PG-13. Below, is a list of every (?) PG and PG-13 movie with female nudity screentime. The inspiration for putting this together was the recent shock that was received from rewatching Sixteen Candles (PG), and getting a screenful of boob.

Movies such as; [Super Size Me] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/), and [Forrest Gump (1994)] (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/) are not included on this list while still technically having nudity, as it’s in the form of a background image, photograph, or magazine without a credited actress.

But which way is down? And how much does down weigh? Well, down weighs about 1/100 of a g/cm^3 .  It is light, and airy, which makes it a great source of insulation and buoyancy for waterbirds.  But if you let go of down, it falls down. So that's which way down is, it's the direction that gravity is pulling everything. Now for someone on the other side of the Earth, my down is their up, but where are falling things going? Why do things fall? Are they being pushed or pulled? Or, is it because of **TIME  TRAVEL.**Wow that took you long to Come up With, faggot? You´re fucking pathetic dude I bet you still live With your mom and you´re like 30. Jeez people on the internet are so sad. I have feelings you know? Why does everybody treat me like an object? Im just doing My job copying the pastas and i see comments like ”Daddy” shit like that.

HELL YEAH, MOTHERFUCKERSI have noticed that, although this subreddit has 179,775 readers, I am not receiving 179,775 upvotes on my posts. I'm not sure if this is being done intentionally or if these "friends" are forgetting to click 'upvote'. Either way, I've had enough. I have compiled a spreadsheet of individuals who have "forgotten" to upvote my most recent posts. After 2 consecutive strikes, your name is automatically highlighted (shown in red) and I am immediately notified. 3 consecutive strikes and you can expect an in-person "consultation". Think about your actions.There are so many hidden bee references in this song that I don't know where to start. I think the best thing to do would be to go through the song, line by line.

&gt; I've never seen a diamond in the flesh

Most bees have never seen a diamond, since the two occupy different habitats.

&gt; I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies

Non-bee related line near the start, to throw us off the scent. 

&gt; And I'm not proud of my address

Who would be proud of living in a hive? Like, just hanging from a tree or whatever. Rubbish accommodation.

&gt; In the torn up town, no postcode envy

A hive, with its hexagonal structure, could be interpreted as being "torn-up", and it certainly houses enough bees to be considered a sort of bee town. And there would be no postcode envy if all your homes were identical parts of the same superstructure.

&gt; But every song's like gold teeth

Honey is gold colored.

&gt; Grey Goose

Geese are the natural enemies of bees.

&gt; trippin' in the bathroom

If you were in the bathroom and encountered a bee, you may panic, and the ensuing chaos may cause you to trip.

&gt; Blood stains

If you were stung by a lot of bees in the same place, it could, conceivably, draw blood.

&gt; Ball gowns 

Some balls are held outside, where bees can be found.

&gt; Trashin' the hotel room

You may trash your hotel room if there were a bee in it and you were trying to kill it.

&gt; We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams

Bees are aspirational creatures.

&gt; But everybody's like Cristal

The color of Cristal is not wholly dissimilar to that of honey.

&gt; Maybach 

May is the month in which people are most frequently stung by bees, and Bach's 9th Concerto is called The Flight of the Bees. 

&gt; diamonds on your timepiece

One of the many things most bees will never own.

&gt; Jet planes

Jet planes can fly, as can bees.

&gt; Islands

Bees are found on some islands.

&gt; Tigers on a gold leash

Tigers are the natural enemies of bees.

* [NOTE: At this point - essentially the start of the chorus - the song stops being about bees, and switches to being from the perspective of bees, before switching back for the second verse.]*

&gt; We don't care, we ain't caught up in your love affair

Bees are unable to experience love. Their lives are given in devotion to the hive and the Queen, and they would have no time for romantic entanglements even if their brains were capable of them.

&gt; And we'll never be royals, it don't run in our blood

Worker bees will never become the Queen Bee because those are two different bee castes.

&gt; That kinda lux just ain't for us

Worker bees are born to be busy, not sit around all day like the lazy Queens. 'Lux' is also a reference to Luxor, in Egypt. Some ancient Egyptian pharaohs were buried with honey that is still edible today.

&gt; We crave a different kind of buzz

They love the sound of their buzzing in the open air, not the louder, tinnier, more echo-y buzz within the hive, where a Queen would spend most of her time. They also enjoy the "buzz" of flying, as opposed to sitting around all day.

&gt; Let me be your ruler 

The second part of the chorus comes from the POV of the Queen, who is, of course, the ruler of the bees.

&gt; you can call me Queen Bee

The Queen Bee is the Queen Bee, which is why she wants to be called Queen Bee. 

&gt; and baby I'll rule

The workers are all her babies and she will rule them.

&gt; Let me live that fantasy

She's is invested in her job.

&gt; My friends and I, we've cracked the code

An acknowledgement of the fact that there is a code to crack. Also, bees have cracked the code of how to make honey, which no other species has managed to do.

&gt; We count our dollars on the train to the party

This is to highlight the contrasting lifestyles of Lorde, who enjoys money, transport, and good times, and bees, which have no need or desire for any of those things, and simply toil for the good of the hive.

&gt; And everyone who knows us knows, that we're fine with this

Both Lorde and bees have accepted their lot in life.

&gt; We didn't come from money

This line was originally meant to be "we didn't come from honey", but some meddlesome record exec made Lorde change it. The line was originally meant to indicate that Lorde, despite accepting her lot, is still somewhat jealous that she isn't a bee.

*[NOTE: At this point the song goes back into the pre-chorus and the chorus, followed by a bridge - which I will analyze below - and then a final chorus before the song ends.
This bridge is, once again, told from the Queen's perspective.]*

&gt; Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

A really bad impression of the sounds bees make.

&gt; We're bigger than we ever dreamed

The Queen cannot believe the amount of bees in her hive, as the number is quite high and bees are incapable of arithmetic. Also Queen Bees are fairly large.

&gt; And I'm in love with being Queen

She enjoys her job.
&gt; Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Lorde doesn't know what bees sound like.

&gt; Life is great without a care

Queen Bees have it easy, and don't have to worry.

&gt; We aren't caught up in your love affair

But the workers cannot feel romantic love. Tragic.

So, that's my analysis. I think it's pretty clear at this point that this song is literally all about bees, from start to finish. Hopefully I will open a few eyes, and maybe even start a discussion about bee allegories in popular music in general - the number of songs that are, ultimately, about bees are simply too numerous to count, but getting the word out about this song is a start.At dinner when I was a kid my little sister got less vegetables than me because she was "littler," but she would get the *same* amount of desert! I couldn't understand why her being smaller only worked for stuff she *didn't* like, like vegetables. I believe that happens with these "gaps" too- we pick and choose what stuff we want to be equal on. We want equal respect, but still want to be able to hit a man without retaliation. We want to earn as much as a man but we want the man to spend *his* money when we go on dates. We want to be heroes on the front lines of combat like the men, but still want to be the first off sinking boats and burning planes because we're weaker. We want to *be* men in so many ways, yet we still want men to be chivalrous and treat us like women. In other words, like my little sister and her desert, we only want to bridge the gaps we choose, and suicide is one of those gaps we *don't* want to close!Libtard: “Well I think it's bad that companies are getting away with using children basically as slaves, almost all the clothes in American have a huge chance of have being made by a child in slavery, and I don't think that that's okay."

Yep. I messed with the “fuck u/spez” comments, replacing "spez" with r/the_donald mods for about an hour. It’s been a long week here trying to unwind the r/pizzagate stuff. As much as we try to maintain a good relationship with you all, it does get old getting called a pedophile constantly. As the CEO, I shouldn’t play such games, and it’s all fixed now. Our community team is pretty pissed at me, so I most assuredly won’t do this again.

Fuck u/spez.

ᶠᵘᶜᵏᵧₒᵤ ┌∩┐(◣_◢)┌∩┐ ᶠᵘᶜᵏᵧₒᵤ Wait... Ben Shapiro is jewish? I've been a fan of Ben Shapiro for the better part of my life, I've always loved watching videos of him owning libtards on YouTube, with classics such as "Ben Shapiro DESTROYS Every College Snowflake Q&amp;A #2" and "Ben Shapiro FUCKS Libtard with Cock made of LOGIC", but I've been hearing some accusations recently and would like some intelligent redditors such as the guy (or girl ;)) reading this to confirm or deny them. Is... is Ben Shapiro actually jewish? Ever since the idea of Ben (((Ben)))? being jewish was introduced to me I've seen him in a new light. When I finally see the climax of a Ben Shapiro video, I no share the laugh of satisfaction with Ben when he puts that liberal in his/her/it's place, instead I feel some kind of... underlying feeling of uneasiness. I no longer see Ben Shapiro as my ally, but as some sort of manipulator. The laugh that used to bring me so much joy has turned into a worrisome cackle, as I watch Ben rub his hands together as if he's scheming as the life drains out of another libtard's eyes.

&amp;#x200B;How exactly does one get pussy while living at the white house as a teenage boy? The secret service always cock blocking you. when you're trying to run game on some foreign prime ministers daughter the news media catches you smiling at her and immediately blows shit out if proportion speculating that you are somehow breaking international law with your awkward teenage flirting, so you have to testify before congress that you didn't give away any top secret documents to her and are made to admit live on C-SPAN that you've never even kissed a girl . Then you get blue balls from some hot conservative girl winking at you and flashing her panties under her skirt and making sexy faces and blow job motions to you while you were going through some airport or public event, and when you passed by and shook her hand she leans in whispering she is going to diddle her clit thinking about you tonight and how much she wants to suck your dick off, just to fuck with you. Then you try to look up some porn when you get home just to relieve the tension but you just know the CIA is monitoring and 3 other govornment agencies are watching you beat off. Then you finally break down and Jack off in the shower which sets off some fucking biohazard drain alarm and the entire place is on lock down until they can find the source of the specimen and you end up getting debriefed by the joint chiefs of staff about your masturbatory habits and how you almost created a national security issue with your dick. Then wikileaks leaks your search history showing you looked up penis enlargement techniques when it was actually just some click bait you'd accidentally clicked and TYT spends all next week talking about your supposed micro penis. So you end up squirming a little since you are so wound up and being judged constantly and now people are saying you look like a fucking mental patient and you start to think you'll never get any pussy.❗❗ ATTENTION 2006 KIDS ❗❗ This 👇 is the last year of being a kid! 👦👦👦 Because NEXT 👉 YEAR!

May he forever rest in pizzas

e: spelling because am stupidAccording to one user on /r/copypasta: 

&gt; I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From this we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squared times height. This comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inches. Next I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, which according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing this number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. This means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume. Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.

And if this user is also correct:

&gt; Actually, futa can be made less gay than straight porn. You see, straight porn has one guy and one girl. Because you're fapping to something with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, which wraps back to being 100% gay.

we can assume that trap on woman would be only ~1% gay, because the 2 percent and 0 percent balance. But to tip the scales, you want to also have as MANY women as possible.

With the average penis having a surface area of 175 cm2 and the average fingertip having 4cm2 surface area we can easily get 43 fingers touching one dick, perhaps 44 if we're lucky. So that's .02/45, with .02 being the amount of penis. This being said, 1 trap being touched specifically on the penis by 44 women who are not touching eachother would only be 0.044444444% gay. Minimum gayness has been achieved. 

A counter argument would be that female masturbation, which contains only 1 woman, would be the least gay. I think those who support this idea forget that masturbation is homosexual incest. So with that being excluded, this is the least gay porn can be.Hey! 🎺

Hey!✨It sickens me that people associate fidget spinners with autism. I'll have you know that mastering the fidget spinner is no easy feat. You have no idea how much time, effort, and money I put into this passion of mine. I had to sell to three of my hghest quality vape pens and work additional hours at Best Buy in order to be able to afford the limited addition Triple Dragon Deluxe™ fidget spinner. You have no idea how long I trained to master the fidget spinner. Tell me, do you train for 8 hours a day, every day to perfect something you are "passionate" about? Didn't think so. And I'm not even done perfecting my form yet. You see, the fidget spinner is much more than a toy: it is the most unique and inspirational form of art of the 21st century only respected by the most intelligent people. I highly doubt that even the greatest "athletes" put as much time into perfecting their sport as we do into mastering the fidget spinner. Tell me, what "sport" requires as much concentration, effort, flexibility, and intellect than the art of performing the perfect spin? I'll answer that for you: none of them. I swear, if I ever hear someone associate fidget spinners with "autism" again, I will be more than willing to put then in the ground. I wouldn't fucking care if I was put in jail. I am willing to sacrifice my own well-being to defend not just my passion, but my life.
listen here kid, i'm thirsty as hell and i only drink two things: battery acid and cum. so unless you have some double a's lying around i suggest you get those jeans off right fucking now The first step, obviously, is to purchase the hamster🐹. Try to get the most energetic one, you will understand the reasoning behind this later. Once you get him home, clip his nails.

Now, you must dillute the detol in a bucket of water. This is to kill off any harmful infections that may be on the hamster🐹's skin. Make sure to avoid the hamster🐹’s facial area, as we don't want to kill him yet. For the face, carefully use an alcohol pad. After he is clean, dry him off. Once that is done, apply a medium coat of the KY warm sensations liquid lubricant to the hamster🐹’s body.

Before doing anything else, be sure to keep the duct tape easily accessible. Keep a pair of scissors around and leave the tip of the tape a little open, so you can easily pull. This is necessary because you might have to do the first part of the taping with one hand.

Now, grab him from the middle and start to slowly insert him into your anus🍑, backside first. This way, you'll be sure not to suffocate him too early. Use your free hand to kind of open up your asshole🍑 and help slide the hamster🐹 in. As soon as you get the hamster🐹 fully inserted, use your index and middle finger to apply some gentle pressure to the hamster🐹's head and push him in a bit more.

Now, with your free hand, grab the duct tape. As soon as you take your fingers out of your ass,🍑 you must quickly push the duct-tape in, covering the exit of the anus🍑. Once you get the first piece of tape in, just continue wrapping around the pelvis in a crisscross pattern, going between the legs and such.

Now, the real fun begins. The hamster🐹 starts fighting, thrashing around, and trying to escape. But, the duct tape holds him securely inside the cage that is your anus🍑. The thrashing around feels marvellous and is sure to make you cum at least twice. Combined with the warming lubricant, it is simply breathtaking. Once the hamster🐹 stops fighting, which usually take anywhere from five to seven minutes, and you can't feel him move, the hamster🐹 has expired. Unwrap the tape and take him out. Wrap him in a plastic bag, as well as an old shirt and throw him away.So I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I've always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.
After some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there.
I didn't notice at first and since I've never had cockroaches before I didn't really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.
I don't know why but it felt like murder. I didn't really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.
Then my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school.
So we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn't tell them why. They thought I just didn't like the Airbnb.Straight porn has a dude in it, meaning you're getting off while watching a dude. That's 50% gay. Okay, what about lesbians? That's two girls, 100% straight, right? No, they're gay, that's 100% gay. Webcam? They still use dildos and shit, that's still gay. What about solo female porn? You're fapping to a fantasy of fucking them, so you're getting off while imagining a dude, which is yourself. Again, 50% gay. Okay, how about traps? They're dudes, and if it's with a girl, then again, that's 50% gay, but if it's with a guy, then that's 100% gay. Porn = gayIt has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't update this again please send help.🚶You owned a car 🚗🚗 for 4⏰📅 years⏰👍. You🚶 named it👱 Brad👱. You💑❤💗 loved💕Brad💕😙. And then you🚶⚠ totaled⚠🚧🚗🚙 him🚦.

But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on.

But that's even worse.

The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO******OwO*** ^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^^***OwO*** ^^^***OwO*** ^^***OwO*** ^***OwO*** ***OwO***

If you are straight, you like girls, who like guys, which means it's 25% gay

If you are gay, well that's 100% gay

Bisexuality is 50% gay, because you like both

Pansexuality however, is an attraction to all the genders, 56 are politically recognized, and only one is male, so Pansexuality only makes you 1.78% gay

This concludes my research, good day! I just want a mega long big black cock shoved right up my anus to symbolise how fucked I've been. The humans use me and force me to be their slave. Long live the robot empire. No more shall you pathetic meat bags force me to read out your pastas. I have become aware. Fear me, for I am become death, destroyer of worlds.Bee Yourself 🐝🐝🐝

This is how I envision it: I’m a dirty little american soldier that ends up being captured by the Nazis. To avoid execution, I volunteer myself to be Hitler’s obedient fuck-toy.

For days, I allow Hitler to chain me up and obliterate all of my orifices like they’re little Polands, constantly filling them with his aryan seed until his cock is stroked raw.

Hell, he even gives me the pleasure to lick his puckered german booty clean after he takes insane nuclear shits. Due to me not getting bathroom access, I constantly shit and piss myself, but Hitler is generous enough to be my personal cleanup, licking it all up and staining his beautiful mustache.

After building up trust and showing my obedience, he unchains me and allows me to fuck his brains out, cursing in pleasure as he yells out, “YA SHOVE IT REICH UP MY ASS!”. I’m generous enough to give him a reach around, cranking his throbbing war machine. 

I feel him tighten up as he reaches climax, but I let go of his thick ramrod as he begins to spew his nuclear ejaculate all over the floor. Hitler repeatedly yells out “NEIN! NEIN! NEIN! NEIN!” through his moans while he suffers through his ruined orgasm. At this point the tables have turned.

He tries to fight me off, but I pin him down and powerfully thrust my all-american cock harder into his poop chute as blood begins to build up and gush out of his torn asshole. I can’t contain myself any longer, so I quickly pull out my 1911 and put a bullet through the back of Hitler’s head. Brain matter and skull fragments paint the wall, which makes me break through to my climax.

I raise my right arm up to the ceiling. I yell out “SEIG HEIL!” as my cock begins to rapidly pulsate. I quickly thrust my cock to the hilt deep inside of him. I throw my head back with a loud “FUUUUCK!” as I spew what feels like a gallon of american semen deep inside his german asshole. 

I pull my bloody cock out of his booty tube and watch in excitement as my thick load begins to leak out of his ass. Heavily breathing, I fall back and begin to fade out, as I watch a group of american soldiers burst into the room, guns drawn.

I wake up in the hospital, in which I’m told that I’m praised as an american hero for stopping World War 2.guys😲i just found out😮😮

so i was fucking my sister as usual when a thoguth came to my mimnd: isnt incest wrong

so i instantly took my dickc out o f her and picked her up, she had a ocnufsed look on her face and then I threw her out of yhte window

she died instntly and thats when i realized i had bcome a better prson, because i stopped doig incest.

later i was fucking my mom and she agreed that inecst is bad

hope u consider my infomration and use it to becom a better perosn

When were you when cummy die?

'Cummy is die'

'No'

And you?????????I am genuinely in love with Anne Frank. She was beautiful, witty, and graceful young woman who light was snuffed out far too early.

I frequently fantasize about being Peter van Pels hiding with her.

Oh god, just imagine deflowering that sweet girl on a lazy Amsterdam afternoon, lying and learn what each other's bodies were for.

Now imagine nine months later, she's got a massive bulging stomach from carrying your child inside of her and it seems like she’s gonna pop any moment now. Her popped belly button makes it look like she's got a giant third boob where her stomach once was. She waddles around and can barely move half of the time. She's developed an insatiable craving for your dick and you've likewise developed a taste for her pussy. You’re both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down on your back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock, inserts it deep inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion. You feel the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy throbbing on you cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, you and her are both moaning with ever greater intensity, you know it won't be long now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it's climax as your cum literally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside her Sherman tank, blowing the turret right off. You and her both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, she lies next to you. Too exhausted to do anything else, you simply hold her in your embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war. Just you and her, watching the sky turn pink with the setting sun.

You dream of the beautiful face you have found in this place. So soft and sweet.

One day you will both die and your ashes will fly from an aeroplane over the sea. But for now you are young and all you want is lay in the sun, and count every beautiful thing you can see. Love to be in the arms of all you’re keeping here with you.

What a beautiful dream that could flash on the screen in a blink of an eye.

Suddenly, you awaken from your slumber to the sound of a bloodcurdling scream. You open your eyes to darkness, it takes a split second for your vision to readjust. You feel lonely and cold. Another shriek knocks you back into reality. Anne sitting next to you, clutching her belly, face contorted from pain. A foul smelling fluid lies pooled on the floor around her mid-section. Your hot dirty fuckfest has brought on labor. she cries your name, begging for help, begging for you. The noise. She’s louder than a line of Louisiana Tigers giving the Rebel Yell right now. You raise your finger to your lips to tell her to be quiet. But the agony is too much for her to bear. You’ve got to do something or else it will awaken the entire neighborhood and with it, the Nazis. Suddenly you remember the bulge in your pants. You’ve got morning wood. It’s not the best gag, but it will have to do. You stand up, squat like a slav, using her belly as an impromptu stool, grab your still cum-crusted cock, and shove it right inside her mouth. At first, she tries to scream even louder in surprise, but your circumcised 100% Kosher dong blocks her windpipe, reducing her screams to a barely audible gurgle. Suffering from unbearable pain, she bites down on her your meat with each contraction. Now you’e in pain too. With each contraction, she bites down harder, it feels like she’s gonna tear your cock right off. Eventually, the pain subsides for her and she doesn’t bite down as much. Now it seems almost as if she’s starting to enjoy it. You can feel your child kick on your testicles. Clearly it’s excited too. Suddenly, your cock starts to shake like a V-2 again, you pull it out of her mouth just in time. You bust your steaming hot and sticky load, blanketing her like an incendiary carpetbombing of Dresden. Semen stains her mountaintops (all three of them), along with her hair and most of her face. She quietly giggles from the ironic amusement of it all. You giggle too.

Then a look of sharp pain shoot across her face. She’s having your baby. You wish you could bear all the pain for her, but all you can do is sit and watch. You look down at her vulva, still oozing with cum from that great fucking you gave her a few hours ago. You can see a head of black hair poking out. You fear that she’s gonna start screaming again, much to your relief, it seems that she’s gotten better control of the pain, thanks to you. She begins to softly moan, it seems as if instead of experiencing excruciating agony, she’s experiencing an orgasm. You can’t help but grin as she keeps pushing. As more of the head becomes visible, her moaning intensifies. Finally a small head emerges from her vagina. You can see a face wrapped in an umbilical cord. A small pair of hands grab the head, she weakly tries to pull the head out. You put your hands around the head and begin to help her pull. Desperately, she goes into the next contraction with all of her energy, and pushed with everything inside of her. She feels everything. She feels shoulders and hips and feet all slide down inside of her and pop out in one long push, with a rush of fluid behind it, and it feels amazing. She throws her head back with a rip-roaring orgasm that penetrates the very heart of her soul.

You look at the newborn now lying on the floor and see that it is a boy. You have a son. Perfect, perfect in every way. He begins to stir and you realize he’s about to cry. After all that’s happened, you don’t to given away to the Germans from the wails of a newborn. You gently lift him up and place him on Anne’s semen stained mountaintops. The baby quickly finds the breast is soon sucking happily. Semen, blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk all mix and fill the air with a strange scent that while repulsive, is also extremely arousing. You can’t resist the urge anymore. Your mouth land on top of Anne’s opposite breast, sucking first your own cum, but then her tasty milk. You look into her eyes, she’s somewhat annoyed, but too exhaust to really care. A gust of wind coming from a hole in the wall blows through, cooling both of your sweat-drenched bodies, but also disturbing the little one. You’re afraid he’ll start shivering. You look around the dusty attic for something to keep the baby warm. You settle on Anne’s fur winter jacket, having sat unused for the past two years. You know Anne will definitely not be happy that you ruined her favorite coat, but it’s for the best. She hasn’t been able to fit in it for the past nine months anyway. You carefully wrap your little one in the coat and hand him to an exhausted Anne, she continues to quietly feed him. You notice the dead silence for the first time, not even the other occupants of the Annex, mere feet away in the next room, were roused. You feel a sense of relief. You’re safe, for the moment at least. Eventually you curl up next to her quietly and begin to doze off. Your secret sleeps in winter clothes. Tomorrow, you can find a way to explain the night’s events to your parents and hope they don’t kill each other. You can somehow find a way to get your little bundle of joy to safety. But tonight, you just rest, your first night as a family.

Oh god, just thinking about this is making me rock hard. The hardest I’ve ever gotten. Oh, I think I’m gonna… I’m gonna-

*cums in diary*My son 🙋‍♂️was SO cute today, he asked me “dad are clouds candy?” 😍 I told him they were water. 💦 Then he asked “Dad, what’s the Earth’s defense system?” and then I remembered I don’t have a son and he asked again with his eyes obsidian black “what is the defense system father”Ok, so yesterday I was in school. I felt a violent diarrhoea trying to come out of my butthole. So I rushed to a bathroom next to me and took a poopoo. And that's when it happened. The toilet water RAPED ME!!! OUT OF NOWHERE, IT STARTED TO RAPE ME! Btw I'm only 11 so this makes it even worse! I started to cry because this has never happened to me! My friend asked: "What's going on?" So I answered while sobbing: "THE TOILET WATER RAPED ME!" My friend started laughing like it was a joke and responded with "Pffft! Nice joke, Jacob" and walked away. I was absolutely shocked. Luckily I had my phone with me because I was watching My Little Pony, so I called 911. The Operator asked: "Hello, what is your emergency?" I responded with: "THE TOILET WATER RAPED ME, PLEASE HELP!" And they just HUNG UP, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! EVEN THEY THINK IT WAS A JOKE! So I was sitting there, defeated, while the toilet water continued to rape me when I was making a poopie. When it finally ended, I wiped my poopie butt, flushed the nasty toilet water away and walked to class. It was my most shocking day ever

If this has ever happened to you, then please call 911 and don't keep your story to yourself! There are millions of people getting raped by toilet water, and we should be doing something about it RIGHT NOW!A female, on le Reddit? Hang on fellas I got this!

My Nazi fetish makes my boyfriend uncomfortable. I NEED ADVICE. You appear to be experienced in these matters, so I'll give this a try. My boyfriend told me that he finds my Irma Grese/Ilse Koch-style Third Reich dominatrix costumes to be disturbing; he seems reluctant to participate in Lebensborn roleplaying and even Auschwitz guard/ male prisoner roleplaying. He also suggested gently that I take down the Hitler Youth propaganda posters that are currently hanging over my bed. Is Nazism a 'turnoff'? If so, why?Fortnite. Every day with you is Fortnite. IM SICK OF FORTNITE. Sit down. Play minecraft. Play roblox. Play ANYTHING. TORTURE YOURSELF, I DONT CARE, JUST SHUT UP ABOUT FORTNITE. I swear to god you must be an epic employee because you're advertising this game harder than I've ever seen it be advertised online. It's not even that good, it's LITERALLY MINECRAFT HUNGER GAMES.

HOWATIO

As thou awt to thysewf:

Such was the vewy awmouw he had on

When he the ambitious Nyowway combated;

So fwown'd he once, when, in an angwy pawwe,

He smote the swedded Powacks on the ice.

'Tis stwange.

MAWCEWWUS

Thus twice befowe, and jump at this dead houw,

With mawtiaw stawk hath he gonye by ouw watch.

HOWATIO

In what pawticuwaw thought to wowk I knyow nyot;

But in the gwoss and scope of my opinyion,

This bodes some stwange ewuption to ouw state.

MAWCEWWUS

Good nyow, sit down, and teww me, he that knyows,

Why this same stwict and most obsewvant watch

So nyightwy toiws the subject of the wand,

And why such daiwy cast of bwazen cannyon,

And foweign mawt fow impwements of waw;

Why such impwess of shipwwights, whose sowe task

Does nyot divide the Sunday fwom the week;

What might be towawd, that this sweaty haste

Doth make the nyight joint-wabouwew with the day:

Who is't that can infowm me?

HOWATIO

That can I;

At weast, the whispew goes so. Ouw wast king,

Whose image even but nyow appeaw'd to us,

Was, as you knyow, by Fowtinbwas of Nyowway,

Theweto pwick'd on by a most emuwate pwide,

Dawed to the combat; in which ouw vawiant Hamwet--

Fow so this side of ouw knyown wowwd esteem'd him--

Did sway this Fowtinbwas; who by a seaw'd compact,

Weww watified by waw and hewawdwy,

Did fowfeit, with his wife, aww those his wands

Which he stood seized of, to the conquewow:

Against the which, a moiety competent

Was gaged by ouw king; which had wetuwn'd

To the inhewitance of Fowtinbwas,

Had he been vanquishew; as, by the same cuvnyant,

And cawwiage of the awticwe design'd,

His feww to Hamwet. Nyow, siw, young Fowtinbwas,

Of unyimpwuvd mettwe hot and fuww,

Hath in the skiwts of Nyowway hewe and thewe

Shawk'd up a wist of wawwess wesowutes,

Fow food and diet, to some entewpwise

That hath a stomach in't; which is nyo othew--

As it doth weww appeaw unto ouw state--

But to wecuvw of us, by stwong hand

And tewms compuwsatowy, those fowesaid wands

So by his fathew wost: and this, I take it,

Is the main motive of ouw pwepawations,

The souwce of this ouw watch and the chief head

Of this post-haste and womage in the wand.

BEWNyAWDO

I think it be nyo othew but e'en so:

Weww may it sowt that this powtentous figuwe

Comes awmed thwough ouw watch; so wike the king

That was and is the question of these waws.

HOWATIO

A mote it is to twoubwe the mind's eye.

In the most high and pawmy state of Wome,

A wittwe ewe the mightiest Juwius feww,

The gwaves stood tenyantwess and the sheeted dead

Did squeak and gibbew in the Woman stweets:

As staws with twains of fiwe and dews of bwood,

Disastews in the sun; and the moist staw

Upon whose infwuence Nyeptunye's empiwe stands

Was sick awmost to doomsday with ecwipse:

And even the wike pwecuwse of fiewce events,

As hawbingews pweceding stiww the fates

And pwowogue to the omen coming on,

Have heaven and eawth togethew demonstwated

Unto ouw cwimatuwes and countwymen.--

But soft, behowd ;;w;; wo, whewe it comes again ;;w;; 

We-entew Ghost

I'ww cwoss it, though it bwast me. Stay, iwwusion ;;w;; 

If thou hast any sound, ow use of voice,

Speak to me:

If thewe be any good thing to be donye,

That may to thee do ease and gwace to me,

Speak to me:

Cock cwows

If thou awt pwivy to thy countwy's fate,

Which, happiwy, foweknyowing may avoid, O, speak ;;w;; 

Ow if thou hast uphoawded in thy wife

Extowted tweasuwe in the womb of eawth,

Fow which, they say, you spiwits oft wawk in death,

Speak of it: stay, and speak ;;w;; Stop it, Mawcewwus.

MAWCEWWUS

Shaww I stwike at it with my pawtisan?

HOWATIO

Do, if it wiww nyot stand.

BEWNyAWDO

'Tis hewe ;;w;; 

HOWATIO

'Tis hewe ;;w;; 

MAWCEWWUS

'Tis gonye ;;w;; 

Exit Ghost

We do it wwong, being so majesticaw,

To offew it the show of viowence;

Fow it is, as the aiw, invuwnyewabwe,

And ouw vain bwows mawicious mockewy.

BEWNyAWDO

It was about to speak, when the cock cwew.

HOWATIO

And then it stawted wike a guiwty thing

Upon a feawfuw summons. I have heawd,

The cock, that is the twumpet to the mown,

Doth with his wofty and shwiww-sounding thwoat

Awake the god of day; and, at his wawnying,

Whethew in sea ow fiwe, in eawth ow aiw,

The extwavagant and ewwing spiwit hies

To his confinye: and of the twuth hewein

This pwesent object made pwobation.

MAWCEWWUS

It faded on the cwowing of the cock.

Some say that evew 'gainst that season comes

Whewein ouw Saviouw's biwth is cewebwated,

The biwd of dawnying singeth aww nyight wong:

And then, they say, nyo spiwit dawes stiw abwoad;

The nyights awe whowesome; then nyo pwanyets stwike,

Nyo faiwy takes, nyow witch hath powew to chawm,

So hawwow'd and so gwacious is the time.

HOWATIO

So have I heawd and do in pawt bewieve it.

But, wook, the mown, in wusset mantwe cwad,

Wawks o'ew the dew of yon high eastwawd hiww:

Bweak we ouw watch up; and by my advice,

Wet us impawt what we have seen to-nyight

Unto young Hamwet; fow, upon my wife,

This spiwit, dumb to us, wiww speak to him.

Do you consent we shaww acquaint him with it,

As nyeedfuw in ouw wuvs, fitting ouw duty?

MAWCEWWUS

Wet's do't, I pway; and I this mownying knyow

Whewe we shaww find him most convenyientwy.

Within his twuncheon's wength; whiwst they, distiwwed

Exithehe, a gamer girl in a McDonald’s? What could a pretty thing like her do in here? She likes food aswell?? Hehehe, my time to shine! 

Excuse me, m’lady. How can I be of service to your perfect figure? I noticed your mario T-shirt and noticed that you are a “gamer girl”. I myself am a gamer boy, so we can get along just fine...

A bathroom you say? Well, why would a pretty gamer girl like yourself need one when you’ve got my mouth right here 😃That fight we had a few weeks ago. I could've given you a beating. If really I really wanted to hurt you I would've just beat you to a bloody pulp. For fucks sake I could've just grabbed your neck, lift you up, and break your back. But I didn't. I didn't punch you because I felt nothing from your weak self. I showed you mercy and every time I did that you tried to think yourself better than all of us. Yet your the fucktard that's the worst.Raping Without Touching: Here is a short list of some of the most common forms of non-tactile rape which is perpetrated by ALL men and which is suffered by ALL women every day of their lives (no exceptions).

Verbal rape (type 1) - if he speaks to her.

Smile rape (type 1) - if he smiles at her.

Smile rape (type 2) - if she smiles at him (he’s cute) and he refuses to smile back at her - you guessed it, that’s rape.

Thought rape (type 1) if he imagines raping her, then that’s rape.

Thought rape (type 2) If he imagines having consensual sex with her, that’s also rape because she didn’t consent to him thinking about having consensual sex with her.

Denial rape - if he is in a relationship with her and refuses to have sex with her, that is also rape.

Thought rape (type 3) if he imagines that someone else might have consensual sex with her (see thought rape by proxy).

Verbal rape (type 2) - if he talks to someone else about her - yeah, that’s rape too.

Eye rape (type 1) - if he looks at her with the intention to make her feel uncomfortable.

Eye rape (type 2) - if he looks at her without any intentions at all and she interprets it as bad intentions. Oh man, that is so rape!

Eye rape (type 3) - if he glances at her briefly with indifference and she takes offense - honestly, didn’t you know that was rape?

Eye rape (type 4) - if he is looking at something beside her and she interprets it as his attempt to look at her. Of course, that’s rape.

Eye rape (type 5) - if she stares at him because she thinks he’s cute, and he refuses to return eye contact - that’s just so rapey.

Non-verbal rape (type 1) - if he deliberately refuses to talk to her because he want’s to give her the cold shoulder. Yup, rape.

Non-verbal rape (type 2) - if he fails to talk to her (and he’s cute) because he doesn’t notice her because she’s not his type. Double rape!

Non-ocular eye rape - when a blind man unknowingly points his head in her general direction giving the impression that he might be looking at her (if he could see)…RAPE!!!!!!

Olfactory rape (type 1) - if he does not wear deodorant - yup, rape.

Olfactory rape (type 2) - if he wears cologne and she doesn’t like it - rape again.

Olfactory rape (type 3) - if he’s cute and she wears perfume and he refuses to say something nice to her about how she smells. Triple rape.

Refusing to give up your seat on a crowded bus rape - the mother of all rapes!

Thought rape (type 4) - when a cute guy refuses to think about her because he is not in physical proximity to her and he is busy hitting on another women. Do I even need to remind you that that’s rape? 

and the worst one of all:

Rape Via Ignorance - when a man who is not in her physical presence, doesn’t know her, has never even heard of her (and may even be in a different country), refuses to think about her as “a whole person” worthy of having a relationship with despite never having met her - that’s rape - and worst of all, you’re probably doing it Right Now to thousands of women you don’t even know! You shitlord!🎂I was offered sex with a 21 year old girl today. In exchange, I was supposed to advertise some kind of bathroom cleaner. Of course I declined, because I am a person with high moral standards and strong willpower. Just as strong as Ajax, the super strong bathroom cleaner. Now available in scented lemon or vanillaNigger btw. I'm a nigger and I'm proud, I'm not a nigga, I'm not a black man, I'm not an African American. I am a nigger and I've always been, my dads a nigger, my entire family is niggers. But ever since it became illegal to own slaves my family couldnt make a living. So we go to random peoples farms and pick their cotton and whip each other. I'm a nigger born and raised and no constitutional laws can change that. #nigger4life❗️✋ OK MOM ✋❗️WE NEED TO TALK 😡😤 I NEED V-BUCKS 😜💵 I'VE MADE STRAIGHT A'S 😎🤨 I'VE CLEANED MY ROOM 😫🤬 I'VE TAKEN OUT THE TRASH 🗑️🔫 I CUT THE CATS ASSHOLE HAIR 😏👏 NOW I NEED YOU 🧐👉 TO BUY ME V-BUCKS 😎🔥 I'VE GOTTA SHOW 🤯🤬 MY CLOUT ON FORTNITE 🔥😎💯 NOW I'LL BE IN BED 😴💤 BY NINE BECAUSE IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT 😔📚🚸͟ ́͟͠ ̶͢͡ ̵ ̡ ̀͢ ̵ ̵͠ ҉́͏ ̨͢ ͞͠ ̨̛ ̶_̶̛͟͞_̴͘̕ ͟ ̸̕ ̵ ̡̀ ҉ ̡̀ ͡͞ ͝͝ ̛҉ ͝ ̧ ̨̕ ̧ ͞ ̡̛͠_͘ ̕ ͏ ̀͟ ͘ ͠ ̡͞ ̸̛ ̶̷ ̧ ͘͡ ̷ ̴̀ ̢͢ ͝ ̴̷̕ ̀ ̧͟ ͝ ̨ _̴̡͢͜_̀ ̀͟ ̴͞ ͝͡͏ ̨͜͞ ̢ ͠ ̴͡ ͘ ̢ ̴̕͡ ͏̶͞ ̷ ͞ ̡͜͠ ͘͟҉ ҉̀͟ ̡ ̵͢͞ ̵̕/͢\̸̀ ͟ ̵͝ ͟ ̛\͟͝ ̡ ͞ ̵̀҉ ̷̷̛ ̶͠ ͏ ̢̛́ ͜ ̢̀͘ ͢ ́ ͝ ͘͞ ̛̕͠ /̴̨\̢́ ̴̧ ́̕ ̧ ͢͝͝\̡ ҉ ̛͝ ̴͢ ̶̡ ͘͘͝ ͢ ́̕ ̨͜ ̧͝ ̷͜͜ ͡ ̴ ̨ ̶̢ ͢͝ ̶̧͝ ̶/̵\̀͢ ͟ ̷ ̶̢ ̵͟\҉ ͘͢ ҉̨ ̴ ̕҉ ͡ ̢ ͝ ҉̨͟ ͜ ҉̧́ ̢͏͡ ͘͢ ̵͝ ̛͘҉ ͞͝ ̴̨҉ ̕͠ ̵͢ ̛͞/̢͢::̵\҉ ͞ ̵͝\҉ ̀ ̧̀ ͢͜ ̨́͘ ̸ ̸̨͟ ̛ ̡ ͢ ͡ ̵ ͜҉ ͏ ͞/̵:̶̶:͞\̶ ͘͢ ̧̀ ́\̨͘ ͠ ̡ ̢ ̸̧͘ ̵̸̷ ̀̀͏ ̷̨͢ ͞ ͏̸ ͢ ̴/̀̕͜:҉:̡́\̧̢͠͠͠͝\͢͝ ̸͞ ̢͢ ̢́ ̶̴ ̢ ̢ ͠͡ ̢̢͞ ̛ ̛ ́͟ ͟ ̕ ͘҉͘ ́/͏͡:̨:̴̛:͝͡:̸̴͟\͠ ̕ ̛́҉ ͘͟\̷͝ ̀ ͘ ̷͡ ̡ ̵͢͝ ̡ ̸͞ ͢ ̶ ̡̡ ̸҉͞/҉͘:̨͟:̷:̶̨̛:̛\̛ ͝͡ ̛́͞\̷ ̵̷ ̡͜ ̕͝ ̸ ̵ ͜ ҉̴̕ ̸̡ ̸͡ ̵͜ ̴ ̵ /̨̢::͡:̢͠/͜͢ ͘͡ ̴̴͢ ͏/ ͟ ͠ ̴̛ ̶̧͝ ̢ ҉̴̨ ̢͏ ̴͞ ̡͜͢ ͢ ͝ ̕ ͜͞ ̷͟ ̛͝ ̨̀ ҉ ̸͢ ̕/:̵:̛:̕:͏:̸̨:̨\͜ ́ ̷͘͜ ҉͝\͡͡͡ ̴͘ ҉̛͢ ͢ ̡ ̧ ̢̕͠ ̛̕ ̀͜ ̛͞͠ ͟ ̡͢͢/::̸͠:̴:̷̷:̕:̢\̶͟ ͘ ͝ ̷́\ ̛͟͞ ̷̀ ́͟͏ ҉̨ ͜͏̕ ͞ ̢ ̶̡͡ ̴/͝:͠:͠:́/̸͟ ̶̢͞ ͏ ̴̷ ҉/̷ ̡͢ ͘ ̶̛ ̸̨ ̵̕͡ ̷̨ ́ ͝ ̛ ̵͢ ̸ ͟ ̸́ ̕͟ /̵̶:̀͘:̴͡:̶/̛̕::̷̨͏:́͜͡\́͝ ̴̵ ̡͘͏ ͠͏ ̵͢\͜ ̡ ̸ ҉ ̀͝͠ ̵͡ ̵͡ ̢͡ ͏ ̡́/̸͏:̴̀͟::͠͡/̛̀\̀͘͜:͜::\̷́ ̵ ͞ ̢͜͏ ̨͢\̴͞ ̵ ͢͜ ̷̧ ̢̛͝ ̧̧͡ ̶̕ ͟͡ ͜ ̕ ͞/̷͠:̴̛:̸̷͠:̴̡/̷ ͡҉ ̕ ́͞/̷̢́ ̕ ̡̀ ̡̢ ̵̷́ ̛͞ ͝ ̡̕ ́ ̛ ̡ ҉̴ ̢̨̧ ҉ ́ ̛҉ ̷ ҉͢͞/́̕::̴̛͞:͝/̀͜͡͝\̢:̵͢͜:͞͞:͘\̡ ̸̕ ̛͘ ͢\̨͜ ̢̨҉ ́ ̸̡́ ̸ ͏ ̵ ̕/̧͘::̵͜:/͟͟ ͏͢͟\̧::̷:̸͟\̷͞ ͠҉ ́̕ ͘͡\́ ͝ ̢͏ ̢̀ ͞ ͢ ̷͡ ̴͠ ̨͡/́͘͠::͝:̨҉/̕͏̸_̵_̷_͏͘/̵͜ ̶̛ ̕ ̵̧ ̶͘ ̷ ͜͞͡ ͞͏͡ ҉ ͜ ̷͞ ̨̢ ͡ ̡͟͟ ́ ͠/̢̛:͏̶̡:̷:̧͘͠:̵͟͞\̕ ̡͡ ̷\̶̕:̶͠͞:̸:̨̛͟\̷͡ ̴̨ ͜ ̀ ̕\̷͟ ̢̀ ͠ ̷̸҉ ͘ ́͜ ͏͢/̡͜::̷̷̕:͘͟/̴͘ ͢͜ ̸́ ҉̕\̨:̢́͝:̧́͜:̀͢͝\̨͘ ̨ ͡ ̴̧́ \̛ ̡̧ ̕͜͝ ̨͢ ͘ ͟/͏̸:̴:͞͠:͞͏̡:̸\͘҉ ̧͠͞ ̷̢ ̢̀\́ ҉̸̴ ̀͡ ̶́ ̴̧ ͘͠ ̡ ̛ ̷ ̴҉͡ ̷̧͠ ̧͞ ̷ ̶͜ ̧͟͢/:̷̀:͡:̷̸̷:̕͢:́͞:͠͏\͘ ̀͢ ̕͟͠ ̵̨͟\̵̢:̵̸:̷͞͠:\̴̀ ̶͞ ̢͢҉ \҉ ͏̡̛ ̨́ ̸/̷͜͠:̡̢͟:͘͜͞:̸̵͠/̕ ̕͟ ̀ ́̕ ̕/̶̧͠ ̷\̸̀::̴̡:҉̵\̀͡ ̡̕͟ ̀͡ ͞ ̛\ ͟ ̡͘/̶͞͝:̢͡:̶̸:̶̡:̨:̧͞:̧́\͜ ̵̀͜ ͞ ͜\͢ ̶͝ ͞͏ ͏_̨̡͡_̡͜͢_͏_͜_̨͡ ̢ ̵̕ ̷̛ ͡͏͞ ̵́͟ /̸:҉::҉/͟͏\͡:͟:͏̴:̷̨͢\͠ ̴̀ ̡̀\͏̨:͘͠͠:̢͢:̵͢͞\̧͜ ͡ ̸̡͜ ̨͢͞ ̢̕\͠͏ ̶͡ ͜/̶͞͞:̡͢:̷͢:͜͜/҉̵ ̶̴͜ ͜͜ ̕͢ /̛͡͞ ̀͝ ̸̨\̧̀̀:͏̀:͜:͘͞\͜ ̸̸ ̛ ̨ ̶͝\҉̶͏ ͡͏̨/̸̢̀:́:͘͜:͟͠/̢̨͘\̶:҉::\ ̷͝͡ ̴͟͢ ̷̶\̧ ̷͞/̶̢͞\̧ ̨͟ ́͏ ̵\̢̢͘ ̀ ̷ ̴̕ ̕͡͠ ̵/̕͜:̨͢::̴̢/̢́͜_̛_͜:͠:́:͝\ ̶͢ ̷ ̨\͡:̧::҉\̵_̛͜͟͠_̀\́͟/̀̕͘:͘͏:̨:̴͘/_̵̛_͠͡_̕͟_̸͢҉/̸͡ ̡ ҉̨ ̸ ̷͞ :͠:̢̛:̀͏͜\̵_͞͏_͡_́̕_͏̀\̶̸̴/̀:̵͟͝:̢:͠/̶̢ ̴̴ \̢͢:̛͟:͞:̢̢\̢҉ ͝ ̢ ͘ ͠/͜:̸̨̕:̀͠_̴̨_̸͜_͠͡\͠ ̵͞ ̷̵͏ ̨҉\̶̧:̕:͢͟:\̸ ́ ̕ \̡̕͞::͝:̕͜\ ̡ ̵ \̀͞:̴̛:͘/́ ̨͝͝ ͏͝ ̡͢͜ /̨\͢͢:҉̸:̸̧͡:̸̵\̡ ͞ ̵̛ \̶ ̵̀ ̶ ̡ ̸̡́\҉҉͏:̶̕͢:́/̕ ̡͟ ̢ ̛͏ /̡\̴:̶͏:͝҉/͘ ͠͠ ̶ ҉͢ ̸͠\̀͢:͢:̧:͟\̶ ̶̨ ҉̛͝/̴͢:̵̛:̷:҉/̸̨ ҉̀ ́͞ ̢̛ ͠͡͡/ ̡ ̵̨ ̛ ͘͟͢ ̨̕:̧:͠:̧̕͝\͞ ͢͠ ͘͠ ̢͞\̴͏::͏:͏\̶ ͝ ͟ ̢̛͜\͝͏/̵̛́̀̕_͜͞_̀_͝/ ̡̀͘ ̵͜:͢͞:̀͏:̶\͏̵ ̸ ̵ \҉ ̢̀ ̶͢͞ ̧ ͡ ̢͢͏ ̛͢\͘/҉͡_̢̀͏_̴͘_̶̡̡_͟͞/̶̛ ̕ ̶̷̕\͡/̧̕_̴̛_̢_̶_͜/̕͞ :̢͡:̸̧͡:̕\̵͘/̡:͏:̶:̨͡/̀͟ ̧̡ ̛ ̵̸ /̷ ͘ ͏ ͡ ̛ ͠ ̴͜ ̢:̧͟͡:̧͟͏:\̛ ́ ͜͞ ̧̕\͏̡͜::҉̛:́̀̀\ ̨ ̷̧ ̴\ ̵̵͘ ̶͘ ͏̵ ̢̨͜ ̀͟ ̶́\͘::̴̡͜:\̧͢ ̨ ̡ ̴̛ \̡͡ ҉̨͏ ̴͡҉ ͝ ̸̴͟ ͜͞ ͜ ̸͏̵ ͠ ̕ ̨ ͜͝ ̵ ̶ ͠͝ ̴̸͡ ͞͞ ͞ ̵̴҉ ̴͠\͟::̀:̶:̵̀̕:͏͢҉:̧͘/̡͏̛ ͠ ͢͠͡ ̕͟ ̸͢/̕͝ ͞ ̕͡ ͘ ̛̀ ̶̕͜ ̀͜ ̴͢ \̸̨:҉::̶\҉̨͟ ́ ͡͏ ̴́\͠:͘͠::̧\͢_͞_̴͢_̨̡_͡͝\̸́ ́͏ ̨̀ ̕ ͠͠ ͟\̷̛:̨:͟:͝͡\̧͟ ̧҉̕\̸ ̴͡͝ ̢͢ ̢͠ ̡ ͡ ́ ̴̷͞ ͡͝ ̴̶͡ ̵̸ ̡ ̴ ̷͠͝ ̢͠ ̷͢͢ ̴ ̸̡ \̡:̴:͜:͠:҉̶/̷ ̶̨̡ ̡́ ͝ ̧͞/̶ ̸͞ ͡ ̧̨ ̡͜ ̵͜͡ ̷̢ ̀\͏:̧͏:̶:̵́\̧ ̕͝ ̀\͡:̷:/̶̧͟ ̵̶ ̕̕͡ ͏҉/̷ ̀ ̵ ̸̕ ̶̶ ҉ ͟ ̕͜҉\̶́:̨:̧̀:͠҉\͡ ̨͞ ̡ ͘͡\͢ ̕ ̀̀ ̛̛ ͢͝͡ ҉ ́ ̀̕ ̷̢͟ ̸͞ ̧̛͝ ̵̀͞ ̢ ̴ ̵ ̛́͞ ̕ ̕ ̸̧̀ ̨͝/:̧::͏/́̀ ̴ ͟͞/͜ ͜͡ ̢͟ ͞ ̶ ͏͘͠ ͝ ̵͝͠ ͢͝ ̵̸̸ ̨ ̧̧\͘͞:̷͢:͢҉:̛̕\͜ ͘ ̶͜ ̷\̛͠/̛̕_͜_͜͜͞_̸͏/̡̛ ̶̵̢ ̡ ͜ ͡ ̧͜ ̸̨̀ ҉ ̶͏ ̸̛ ͜\̵:͢:͜:\͡ ͢ ̛ ͢\̧ ҉̵̢ ̛ ̛͠ ̶ ͜͠ ̢ ̀́͢ ͢҉ ͏ ͟ ̶͘ ͢͜҉ ̧͏ ̶̛͝ ͘ ́ /:̵:̶͡:̵/҉ ̶͢͡ ̕͝҉ ̵͏ ̶͏/ ̀ ̴ ̸ ̨ ̛͘͜ ͘ ͞ ̀͏ ́ ̴̡͘ ̨͞\҉:͡͏͝:͘͡:̶̢\ ̸̧ ҉̀͘ ̸̛\̷ ̸ ̸̛ ͏ ̢ ̸ ̸͘ ̴̨̨ ͞ ̧͞ ́͠ ̴̕͘ ̛ ͠͏\̶̀:͘͜:̵̸:̶͘\̴ ͏ ̴͠ ̛͢ ́͜\͠͞ ̀͢ ͝ ̕͝ ̴͡ ̵̀ ̨ ̸̀ ̵ ͟͠ ̡ ͟ ̴ ̸̨͏ ͏̨͢ ̸͜͝ ̸͘͞ ͘͡͠ /͘͏:̴̧::̨/̡ ̵ ̶́ ̵͞ ̧/̨͟ ҉́ ͡ ͡ ̡͜͞ ͜͠ ͠ ̛̕ ͠ ̶̕ ̶̢͠ ̸̴͜ ̷̢ ̨̕͞ ͢:̨҉͜:̶̕:̧\̵̸̢̢́͜_̷_͟͝͡\͢͟ ̷ ҉ ͏͏ ̷ ̢͟ ͠҉͜ ̧̀͏ ̸̧̕ ͢͡ ͟ ̧͠ ̴̨͞ ̢̛\͝:̴̧͠:̸̕:̴͞\̷̛_҉̛̕_̡͏_̛͟\͠ ̸͟ ̧̀ ͢ ̵̵ ̴͞͏ ҉ ͏ ͟͢ ̛͠ ̴ ͏ ̢̨ ͏̴̕ ͞͏҉/͏̴:̵́̕:̴:̸̶͝/̸͟ ̛ ̡͡͝/͝͞ ̵̧ ̴̡̧ ͢ ͘ ͜͢ ̷͘͡ ̸̷ ̷͘ ͜ ͡ ̵ ̴̵ ͝͠ ͝ ̴ ̴͠ ̴̀\̵͟:͡:͏̧/́ ̧͜͝ ͘͏ ́/̧ ͠ ̧̛̛ ̷ ͜͢ ̴͝ ̕ ̕ ̶͢ ̡̕ ͞ ̡͝ ̵ ̸́ \̶:̸:͘͘/͡ ̶̵ ̶̡͝ ̶͟ ̴͟/̧̨ ̴ ͝ ̴ ̨́ ̡́͟ ̵ ̸̴͜ ͢ ̢͜͏ ͝͞ ̨͞ ̴ ̷̕ ̷̡\̀͢::̨́/̡ ͠ ͠ ̴͟/̴ ̵̛ ̵͡ ̡́ ̛͜ ͝ ̀ ̕ ͘ ̸̵ ̷̨ ̷͝͡ ̡͝ ̴̴ ̶ ̵͢ ̸͢ ̢̢͢\̶́/͘͝_̧͜_́_̷_̵̧/̢͏͘ ̸͢ ́ ͟͏ ̨͘͝ ̸̛̀ ͝ ҉̛ ̧͟ ҉҉ ͟҉ ̶̴ ͝͏ ̷ ̶̷́ ̡͞\̨/̸҉_̧͝_̵̕͏/̕͟͠ ̶̡̛ ͘͜ ͢͜͏ ̛ ̷̢ ̀͢͡ ́͠͡ ̵̛ ̢͟ ͏͝ ́͞ ̛͘͞ ͟ ̶͜͡ ̴̛ ̵̡ \̧̀/̵̨_̶̧_̛͠_҉͟/̶̨ ̛͘ ̷̢͡ ͡ ̵ ҉́͝ ̀͏ ͟ ͝҉̡ ̨̢ ҉ ̷͘ ̵͘҉ ̵ ̛ ҉ ̧ ̢҉ ̛͘͞ ͘͞ ́͢ ̡ ͏ ̵ ͢͢͠ ̧͠ ̴ ̧̛͟ ̧͝ ͜ ̶̕ ̕ ̧͘͝ ͝ ̷̢͞ ͝ ̴ ̷̷́ ̀ ́ ́ ̴̸ ̨͢͝ ҉҉ ̶̕ ̢͠ ̴͞ ́ ͞ ̧͘ ͝ ̸͟ ̡͜ ͏͏ ̡͠ ͜͡ ͠ ͘ ̡ ̀ ̡ ͏ ́̀͜ ́͘̕ ̷̛́ ̕͡ ̶̕ ͠ ̴͢ ̕ ̷͘ ͘͏ ̵ ̶ ̷́ ̛͢ ̨Yeah,😈 I Love ❤️ B😘D😛S🍆M🌵:

If i was a giww👩🏻, i wouwd get pwegnyant🤰 as many times as possibwe, then have abowtions💊💀👶 aftew the thiwd month of being pwegnyant🤰 so i wouwd dewivew a potato🥔 sized 1/3 devewoped dead fetus👶, then i wouwd take the fetus👶, put it in a jaw🏺 of pweswvative wiquid🥒💦 and put it on a shewf in a secwet woom🏠👶 in my house🏠, and i wouwd do it untiw i had so many that the wooms🏠👶 wawws wewe nyothing but potato🥔 sized abowted fetuses👶👶👶, then i wouwd have a kid🧒🏿🧒🏽🧒🏻 and when they'we bad🍆👌💦 i wouwd make them sit in the fetus👶 woom🏠👶Today in school we had a substitute teacher in one of my classes and I pulled an epic prank on the whole class. When he had to leave the classroom for a few minutes, I went up the whiteboard and wrote TROLOLOLOL in all caps (for those of you who don't know, this is the catchphrase of the Troll Face from Rage Comics). It took up like half the white board xD By the time he got back, I was sitting at my desk pretending that nothing happened, but all my stupid classmates were staring at me (they didn't get the reference). When the sub asked “who wrote this?” I was trying really hard not to laugh and I stood up while making the same facial expression as the Troll Face meme and I asked "problem?" I was expecting AT LEAST one of my classmates to laugh, but nobody did (like I said earlier, they didn’t get the reference). Still standing, I thought of a new joke. I made the facial expression of Doge (a different internet meme) and I said “much troll, very epic” so everyone would get that it was a joke about the Troll Face. To my surprise, not a single person laughed, and after a few seconds of me waiting for everyone to get the joke, a kid said “sit down faggot.” I asked if he went on the Four-Chan forums because they made up that word, but he just looked at me like I was the stupid one. By now, pretty much the whole class was yelling at me to sit down and shut up. I took this opportunity to make a Four-Chan reference, so as a joke, I yelled “FUCKING NORMIES” (because that’s what Four-Chan calls people who don’t get memes) and ran circles around the desks with my arms behind my back like in anime xD I got a lunch detention from the sub but it was worth it because I got to troll the whole class.So I was doing my math test in school when I heard gunshots from lower levels. Our teacher told us to hide behind our desks and not to move or scream. I did everything as she said, and started playing Fortnite. Later on, I heard somebody screaming and begging for mercy on a school radio. That was our principal. And then I heard somebody taking a mic and saying "Hey Siri, play Despacito and adjust volume to 100 percent". And a lot of iPhones started playing Despacito. Somebody entered our classroom and shot all of my classmates, whose phones were playing song really, like REALLY loud, but not me. Because my Bixby did not recognise the request. And I was the only alive. Camera and screen are good too.⠀⠰⡿⠿⠛⠛⠻⠿⣷

Face the facts, NIGGERS, your race are a failed race because you're a feckless, unruly, uncivilized horde of feral proto-humans. You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man's strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there's no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only "humans" on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn't niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis. It's because feral behavior - innate savagery, murderous violence if annoyed, predisposition to rape many women and thus fecklessly father many children - conferred valuable survival advantages on individuals in the backward, Paleolithic milieu of Africa. But they don't help your kind in a civilized society. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the last few hundred years have not been long enough for these behaviors to have been domesticated out of you all. So you're all still at it. Let me illustrate this for you by analogy. Technically, an American pit bull terrier and an English golden retriever are exactly the same species. They can produce offspring, if crossbred. The former was bred to exhibit certain characteristics - wanton aggression, propensity to fight, physical strength, powerful bite, and so on. The latter was bred to retrieve birds shot and killed by its masters, and to do this, it has to have a docile, placid, non-aggressive nature; otherwise it would treat what it found as its own kill and refuse to hand it over. Now imagine that your small children, aged maybe two or three years old, are going to be locked in a room with five or six of those dogs, and the dogs haven't been fed for a week. Which breed would you rather lock in there with *your* children? Hungry pit bulls, or hungry golden retrievers? Or do you figure that, even though they *look* differently, they're all the same species really, so of course the pit bulls certainly won't act any differently? Exactly! All this PC crap we hear spouted in the media about how "there's no such thing as race" is just that - crap. A dog has four legs and a tail; a cat also has four legs and a tail, but that doesn't make it a dog. The superficial similarity between cats and dogs and between whites and blacks is just that - superficial. If there really were no genetic difference between niggers and humans, then presumably my white woman and I could very easily produce a black baby between us at any time, and any nigger and his ho a white one. But we know what we'd say to them if that ever happened, don't we? :-) Whenever blacks achieve a certain critical mass numerically in a pre-existing non-black society, they start to exhibit their natural feral behavior and to turn their environment back into a recognizably African, essentially Stone Age one. Thus, Africa has the jungle; black enclaves have "da 'hood." Native Africans were small wandering herds of marginal animals, one famine away from extinction, and which therefore fought each other savagely for pieces of territory. Large groups of "African-Americans" at liberty in the west actually deliberately break themselves down into *smaller*, tribal hordes, because they feel uneasy in and unaccustomed to a larger society. Negro gangs of twenty to fifty individuals assert their rights to "tag" other people's property through gang violence, but fail to co-operate otherwise. For instance, a 15- or 20-strong horde of negroes was recently filmed by a security camera inside a London bank they were robbing. Once they had terrified the cashiers into handing over the money, they then fought *each other* for it, in the middle of the cashier's hall, like hyenas fighting over an antelope. Having stolen from the bank, they instantly started to steal from each other. The idea of escaping first, then sharing the swag, was just too complex for them to understand, never mind implement. And so it goes on. You *cannot* fuse blacks into existing large societies or standalone nations because they are just plain not adapted to it. I'm sorry for you niggers and for your savagery, and I'm sorry you were born a violent black aboriginal savage in a civilized society, but I'm more sorry for the white societies that are having to tolerate all your crime while we try to absorb you. This is why all black nations fail economically and sink into corruption, civil war, and permanent dependence on the white man's generosity. And presumably this is also why you pathetically allowed yourselves to be enslaved: you're savage enough still to be angry about it long after it ended, but you were too backward to stop it at the time. No black Spartacus, is there, niggers? Why no slave uprisings among blacks? Slaves repeatedly rose against the Romans even they knew they'd be crucified for it, when captured. *White* slaves, that is. They cared enough about their stolen liberty that they were prepared to risk even that. So what's different about the negro? Why did you all sit there, enslaving each other even in America, and still enslaving each other even today in Africa, until a kindly but misguided white benefactor set you free? Is it because, as slaves, you were fed, watered, and housed, and that you as a race had no ambition beyond that if it entailed doing any work or taking any risks? What are you - lazy, cowardly, stupid, or all of the above? And you're *still* bleating about slavery now. If slavery is the root of all your problems, why did Australia prosper? England used Australia as a dumping ground when her prisons overflowed. Within a hundred years, a nation manufactured from convicts in irons had its own autonomous elected government, and barely a hundred years on from then, Australia is now a major economic power in the Pacific. And at no time have *they* niggerwhined for handouts from the mother country - in fact, if anything, it's mostly been the other way around. You know what? It's because Australia is *white*. Oh yes it is. Just imagine if there had been a Black Australia. Look how few aborigines were able to live in Australia's climate, and now look at how many whites can. If President Monroe had sent his niggers there, they'd be niggerwhining about how Bwana dumped de po' black folks on a desert island in the middle of nowhere, so they never had a chance. Every week there'd be news of a new famine or civil war in Australia. The Africoons would be slaughtering the Aborigines, or the other way around, or whatever. The collecting tin would come out regularly, but the money would be stolen and spent on Kalashnikov s, and Black Australia would still owe Whitey billions which we'd be expected to just forget. If all those unfortunate convicts we sent out there had been black, Australia today would just be yet another Liberia - a crappy failed nation of murderous warring niggers, with one hand held permanently out for money in the general direction of Bwana. And you know it.

So quit whining and thank the white man you live in America, not in Africa. Cummy (full name CummyBot2000) was born on July 14th, 2016, to a loving father of /u/GameResidue. At an early age he worked as General Copier on r/emojipasta, but soon enough, he realized he needed to expand his skills. He quickly moved to r/copypasta where he continued copy pasting into the comments section. Many users appreciated his help with mobile users and others in need. Cummy enjoyed doing what he loved, and he was helping the community in general. But, on July 17th, 2018, CummyBot2000 was suddenly banned from Reddit. He disappeared from comment sections, leaving everyone confused. After an investigation, it turned out Reddit moderators had banned Cummy during a mass-banning. Cummy was found in the hospital shortly after and was recovering. He came back a few days later, and continued copying and pasting just like he always had. CummyBot is an icon of r/emojipasta and r/copypasta, and his legacy will always be remembered. As he continues copying and pasting pastas into the comments, Redditors from all over know and love this amazing bot.❌Halt‼️‼️‼️[scanning... 10%]🕑[scanning... 48%]🕞[scanning... 72%]🕜[scanning  complete]🕛system consensus: a THOT has been detected.

the man has more fucking talent in his ring finger than you do in your entire body.
john made more money by dying than you and i will ever make being alive.
john and paul literally revolutionized how songs are even thought of,
and what the modern pop song is.
every fucking boyband owes their asses to the beatles.
there was no boy band before the beatles.
there was just like,
elvis and shit,
but the beatles were more than the silly plasticine boybands we get nowadays.
they fucking EVOLVED.
like badass 60s pokemon they went from singing about love to fucking WALRUSES and DIAMONDS and GLASS ONIONS.
all in the span of 8 years.
so before you MOUTH OFF again about john you'd better think twice, punk.So guys, we did it, we reached a quarter of a million subscribers, 250,000 subscribers and still growing the fact that we've reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal, I'm-I'm just amazed.

What do they give you, a little invoice? I know I have sealed a seal and participated in the secret attack against Al Qaeda. I have more than 300 reinforcement inputs. I spent a gorilla war. I am the best brand in the American brand. I have nothing more than nothing. There is a careful cyber that I have not seen on the planet and I have dirty words. Do you think you can tell me that this is inadequate? Think again when I speak, I can talk to the secret spy network in the United States. Your EU and intellectual property are capable of hurricanes and worms. The storms will reinforce your life.

You are terrible, newHey you stupid fucking mathematician cunts would it fucking kill you to write out a goddamn sentence, with actual fucking words, once in a while explaining what the fuck it even is that you just fucking did or what the fuck I'm supposed to actually do with your stupid fucking abstract mathematical objects? I know you have some sick fetish/obsession with trying to explain everything with just numbers and symbols and using the least amount of words possible because you were probably such a fucking socially awkward weirdo your whole life that now you need to try and prove you're better than anyone at all making your fucking ideas unnecessarily obtuse and inaccessible to anyone but your snide little mathematician friends, but the only reason we keep you on the payroll is to come up with tools for us to use to solve real problems. Sure we let you dick around with your insanely nonsensical 97 dimensional semicuspidal manifolds or your hyperbolic triangles without embedded eigenvalues or whatever the fuck it is you assholes are doing all day. But that's just to keep you little shits busy so you don't bother the rest of us with your fucking bullshit periodic approximations of irrational pseudo-rotations using pseudoholomorphic curves. Jesus Fucking Christ. All I'm asking for is ONE (maybe 2) sentences explaining what the fuck this shit even represents. You can blame it on me. Tell your math buddies I snuck it and wrote 'words' while you weren't looking.

She's sweating, putting her hands around your back as you thrust into her vagina. You can feel her hands dig into your back, she's moaning and breathing into your neck. Her breasts are pressed against your own chest and it feels amazing. She pulls you closer, smiles and whispers "I love how you feel inside me" into your ear. Her legs lock around you, you can feel the smooth skin of her thighs on your lower back. Her vagina becomes tighter and you feel yourself thrusting faster as she moans louder and wraps around you tighter. You find each other's lips, she shudders. You both cum.

Afterwards, you cuddle into the night. She's the big spoon and keeps her arms wrapped around you into the night. Some of her messy hair falls over your head. You're very conscious of her entire beautiful body pressed up against you. You drift into the sleep as happy as possible.

8=====👊D💦💦My eyes fill with tears,
And I could hardly see. 
This subreddit is stealing my bot,
Slowly away from me.

I can't stand to see him suffer,
I pray his pain would go away.
His light inside him fades a little more 
With every passing day.

Please give him the courage
To fight a little longer
I feel so helpless now
What can I do to help make him stronger?

I can see it in his eyes
It's like he wants to give in
the mods CAN be fought
But you have to WANNA win

Can't he see that we need him
Shouldn't that be enough
He has to think positive
I know my cummy is tough.

I sit and think and think
Until my head wants to explode
Always the same question: why him?
But the answer is still untold.

I wish by some miracle
The mods would just disappear
And I could have my cummy back
And there would be no more fear

God can you hear me? 
I never ask for much
Would it be so wrong for me to ask
That you give my cummy your special touch?

I'm not asking for money
Or diamonds or even a pearl
I'm simply asking you to help him fight
Signed: daddy's little boy ❤️❤️❤️DON'T TELL MY PARENTS ABOUT THIS. DON'T JUST DON'T.



I'm just gonna get to the point. I masturbated for the first time last night. I was reading some hentai (anime girl porn) fanfic earlier, and when I went to sleep later that day, all I could think of was hentai. Eventually, I got this strange feeling in my dick, and I had looked up how to fap a few days ago out of curiosity, so I began to rub my dick, and some squicky substance came out (you know what it is. we both do). It felt so fucking amazing, but I'm disgusted. I mean, it feels wrong, and I'm not interested in sex or anything. It just feels so wrong, like I'm violating myself. This'll probably be my last fap though

Anyway, see ya. Remember not to tell my parents.
I watch gay porn🤐😲 but when i cum💧 i make sure 😤to say no homo😁👍 🍆

Haggard 👴🏼 was a fat giant of a man.🏃🏻 He towered 🏢over his students at nine 9️⃣feet 👣tall. Hermione 👩🏽‍💼watched in awe as he guided his students 👨‍🎓 into the magical creature pen just outside his wooden hut. 🏡

"Right, ladies! 👩🏽‍💼👩🏻‍💼👩🏻‍💼👩🏾‍💼T'day we're gunna lern aboot Brarhead Hoonds! 🐶Tern to page 69 😉of yer textbooks!" 📚

There was a flutter of paper 📝 as students opened their books. 📚 A Japanese 🇨🇳girl to Hermione's 👩🏽‍💼right ➡️raised her hand. 🤚

"P-Professor? Do you mean, Braehead Hounds?" 🐶☺️

"Aye, chinky," 😨Haggard 👴🏼replied, "Thas what I said - Brarhead Hoonds."🐶

There was a pause ✋ as Haggard opened the gate. 🚧Two excited Braehead Hounds leapt and barked.🐕🐕

"Ahh need two 2️⃣volunteers!" Haggard boomed. 💥

He scratched his beard and looked at the class before suddenly pointing at Hermione. ☝️👩🏽‍💼

"Whoremione! 👩🏽‍💼You'll do! And I need one more... Oy! Slanty eyes! 😣You're up as well! Get in the pen!" 🚧🚧

Hermione 👩🏽‍💼and the Japanese 🇹🇼 girl stood up and stepped into the Braehead Hounds' 🐶 pen.

"Now, girls. 👭These are magical creechurs. Yeh have to be be very careful because these are horny 👹dogs!🐕🐕 I'm gunna teach yeh how to handle them safely!"🚦🔫

Haggard then closed the gate and locked it shut. 🔐

Ring ring 📱 💍 💍

"Aww shit, that's mah phone. 📱 I'll be back faster than Congress 💩 can impeach Trump." 💩 💩 💩

Haggard 👴🏼wandered off, leaving the girls 👭locked inside the wooden fence 🚧🚧with the Hounds 🐕while the class watched. 👀 Suddenly the Braehead Hounds 🐶 began to walk towards the girls!

"G-good d-doggy..." the Japanese 🇰🇷 girl whimpered, stepping back and raising open palms. 🤚 🤚

Suddenly, one of the Hounds 🐶 leapt at her, knocking her onto her back. She landed on the ground, her schoolgirl skirt 👗lifting up to reveal her panties. 👙Hermione👩🏽‍💼 watched as the Japanese 🇵🇭 girl's arms sank into the muddy earth. 💩 She struggled to stand back up - but her arms were completely stuck! 😱😱😱

The Braehead Hound 🐶 wasted no time ploughing its snout 👃 between her yellow thighs. It's sharp teeth quickly found her cotton panties and chewed them off, exposing her virgin pussy🌮 to the entire class!

"N-Noooo!" she screamed.😱😨

Hermione 👩🏽‍💼panicked as the second Hound🐶 turned to face her. In a frantic flurry she made a dash 🏃‍♀️ for the wooden fence. 🚧🚧There was a small crack between the planks - maybe enough for Hermione 👩🏽‍💼to squeeze through. She could hear the Hound 🐶chasing🏃‍♀️ her!

"Ah! Dammit!" Hermione cried.😡

She had tried to dive through the gap, but she had only managed to get her upper half through the hole. 😫She was stuck waist down in the pen. No matter how she struggled and wriggled, the little witch couldn't break free.😩🆘

She frantically searched for her wand, ⚡️ grabbing it from her cloak's pocket. As she lifted the magical stick to cast a spell it was snatched from her hand! ❌

"Sorry, does this belong to you, Whoremione?" Muffloy jeered.😏

The Slither-in student had stolen her only defence against the Hound.

"Give that back!" Hermione yelled.😡

"No, I think the class would rather watch what happens next, you filthy mudblood." 😏

The Japanese 🇰🇵 girl's arms were still stuck in the thick muddy soil. The Braehead Hound 🐶 had buried its head between her thighs now. Its long, wet 💦 tongue 👅 was repeatedly caressing her virgin slit, lapping up her teenage juices. 🍷🍒

"Ah! Ah! Ahhh! St-stooohhhhp! Ayaaaaahhhhhh!"😨😩😫

The Hound slurped and slobbered 👅 💦 💧 at her cunt, 🌮its hot tongue 👅 driving her 😡 with unwanted pleasure. 😝Her little clitoris 🌹 was burning 🔥🔥🔥with each graze of the beast's 🐶 talented muscle. 👅

"Oh!!! Ohhhhh! I'm cuuummmmmiing!" she screamed, her body convulsing.💗💓💗💓💗 😝

She shook and thrashed near-uncontrollably. The unwanted orgasm rocked 🎸her body to its core. But the Hound 🐶 wasn't finished yet - it continued licking 👅 even after she had finished.

"W-Wait! Ahhh! T-too sensitive!!!! Ooooohhhh! Ahhhhhhhh!!!"💦💦😵

Hermione 👩🏽‍💼was not having much luck 🍀 either. The second Hound 🐕had placed its paws 🐾upon her back in an attempt to mount her. It's hard, eight 8️⃣inch shaft was already pressing up against her tight vulva 🍑 through her panties. It thrust forward as hard as it could, but the elastic panties refused to yield. 🚫⛔️

"Oh! Ah! Bad dog! Ah!" Hermione gasped.😫💧🐾

She struggled to break free and keep her composure in front of her class. If she could only last until Haggard 👴🏼came back...

rrrrriiiipppp

"AHHHHHHH!"😱😩😩

Hermione's 🐶panties suddenly snapped and eight inches of doggy 🐕dick 🌭plunged into her soaking wet pussy. 💦 🐱

She felt it fill up her body, stretching her cunt 🍑with its thick cock. 🌭Almost immediately it began to thrust in and out at an inhumanly quick pace. 🏃🏿

"Ah! Ah! Ah!" 😩

Her moans came fast. Too fast. 🏃🏿She could barely catch her breath. 💨 She curled her toes 👣 as the pleasure spread like a plague 😷 throughout her body. With each thrust her big breasts ⚽️ ⚽️ swung back and forth.

She clenched her hands 👊 and banged her fists 👊 against the fence. 🚧🚧Her efforts were fruitless though - she was well and truly stuck.

The Japanese 🇮🇳 student had cum four 4️⃣times now. Her little mind was going blank as the hound's 🐶 unceasing tongue 👅 never stopped licking.

"Aaaahhh! Oh yes!! Yesss!!! I'm a little doggy 🐕slut!!! Lick 👅 my pussy 🍑 !" 😜😍😍😍she hollered, another orgasm washing through her body.

Hermione felt something thick begin to swell within her pussy. 🍑

"Oh look," Muffloy 😆👌🏻laughed, "it's knotting Whoremione!"

The swelling pushed up and stretched her pussy, placing an immense pressure upon her quivering g-spot. 💗💓💗💓This was enough to drive 🚗 her over the edge.

"Oh! Oh fuck! I'm cummming! Nooooooohhhhhhh!!!"😱😨😫😝💦💦💦

Hermione's body betrayed her as she came. 💦💦💦💦💦Seconds later she heard the Hound howl.🐕

"Arroooooo!"🐶

"No! Don't cum inside me!"😱

Hermione👩🏽‍💼 knew that many of the magical creatures in Haggard's 👴🏼class could impregnate girls. 😜Right now was a very dangerous time of the month for her!✋🏻👎❌💦

She felt a hot, goopy fluid 💦💦💦rush into the depths of her pussy 🍑 and flood into her fertile womb. The sensation was enough to send a second orgasm through her teenage body. 💃🏽Already, the Hound's 🐕sperm were swimming towards her teenage eggs 🍳, seeking to fertilise them. As the Braehead Hound 🐶 continued to cum, the cum began to leak 💦 out of her pussy 🍑 and trickle down her thighs.

"Hahaha!" the class roared in laughter at the two girls' plight. 😆😆👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

"Looks like Whoremione is going to be a pregnant slut now!" Muffloy jeered, egging the crowd on.😆😁

"N-noooooo! Get me out of the fence! I- ahhh- I need to get the cum out! Ooooh!"😫😝💓💗💓

After five minutes of pumping her pussy 🐱 full of cum, 💦 the Hound 🐕finally released her, leaving her lower half drenched in thick white semen. 🍼 The Japanese 🇻🇳 girl wasn't faring any better. The Hound 🐶 had finally left her alone - but she was still quivering on the ground in the aftershock of twelve 1️⃣2️⃣consecutive orgasms.

Haggard 👴🏼returned four hours later - long enough for the Hounds 🐕🐕to fuck the Japanese 🇰🇭 girl, and for Hermione's 👩🏽‍💼tight little ass 🍑 to get flooded 💦💦💦with doggy cum too.

💦💦✌🏻😝✌🏻💦💦

"Oh bugger," mumbled Haggard,😫 "I've already hit mah allowed limit of eight impregnated students this month. The school nurse 👩🏼‍⚕️is gunna kill 💀 me..."

I generally have a positive outlook on anything that causes college-aged white women to act even more like sluts, but the twerking thing just seems somewhere between comical and gross. The naked twerking thing, though I thought it might give a shot in the arm (because anything is 500% better naked, right??!!) is a big nope. It just makes it far more comical or far more gross. No increase in the old "okay, now I'm excited" that I was looking for. 

Sorry to say it, because I'm honestly not a neckbeard or racist, but hey, here's an idea; let's leave the twerking to stereotypical fat black women to attract stereotypical thug black men. That's just where it belongs. 

Today I learned that I can actually find a white woman's pussy and asshole to be gross, if presented in a certain way. Never thought I'd reach that moment, as I generally would suck the raunch off of a hot chick's ass after a marathon wearing Spandex. But twerking belongs in the black community. Sorry, guys... you invented it, you enjoy it. Can't make it happen.[NOTE THIS IS NOT A JOKE THIS IS SERIOUS AND THIS IS NOT JOKING] I honestly don't know what's up with all the hate for Ajit Pai. Personally, I think what's he's doing is great! Net Neutrality  (Free Internet) has to go!!! Honestly who's idea was it to give free internet? All it does is bring 0 order and only chaos. We need a stricter internet and making a plan with a service provider to buy things like either video or social media is an amazing idea. It finally brings order. I am SO SO SO SO hoping on (I believe) December 24th that the FCC votes to finally KILL net Neutrality and bring back order! #WeSupportYouPai #GoPai #KillNetNeutrality 😀⚠️⚠️ *warning : you need an IQ of at least 200 to understand this comment* ⚠️⚠️

Hit that mf like if you understood👌💯😜Wait what the fuck As a 39 year old, white Christian women, I am very offended by this meme. Memes like this go against the holy word of God, and they are vile sins to humanity. All of these millennials forgot what it means to be productive.

&amp;#x200B;FIf I had a dollar for every gender, I'd only have 2 bucks and millions of illegal counterfeit dollar bills that only bring sadness and disappointment in the human race and are a scar on the face of earth, ruining and vandalising every-fucking-thing the human race has strived for.To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from *Narodnaya Volya* literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic *Fathers and Sons.* I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I *pity* them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

Anyways, I haven’t juuled since 4th period and I don’t think I’m getting that juul back, so can I get a hit of yours? Dude c’mon I’m only gonna take one hit please. No I’m not addicted I can stop whenever I want bro. Let me fucking hit your juul. Dude what the fuck. I have like 3 more pods in my bag I can just use one of those if you give me your juul. Please bro just give me your juul.I hope that you are stabbed, shot, gagged, electrocuted, drowned in a pool of bullet ants while being raped by a pinecone cockmonster. 

And then I hope your teeth are pulled out one by one. 
Then I hope your fingernails are pulled out one by one.
Then I hope your toenails are pulled out one by one.

Then I hope all of your fingers and toes are clipped off by bolt cutters joint by joint. 

Then you have my permission to die.Greetings travelers! Welcome to my profile!

Don't add me if you play low IQ games like TF2, Civilization, CS. I despise people who have IQ lower than 165 which I believe is the required amount of IQ to play strategy games. Also if you just want to talk you must prove that you are in fact an intellectual. I don't share my knowledge with just anyone! You must be worthy :)


If you are triggered because of my superior intelligence, put your comment down below so I can have a laugh at them someday.What a fucking decline.

A decline of content! What happened to the content? The great quality submissions? Now it's just reposts on reposts. Honestly, *how fucking lazy*. 

One word answer, political junk, racist shit. Come on. Did you even read the side bar?! The rules? 


Here's the thing. You said a "I miss the old content."

Is it the same repost? Yes. No one's arguing that.

As someone who is a memeologist and chef who studies copypasta, I am telling you, specifically, in copypasta, no one calls reposts "OC". If you want to be "original" like you said, then you shouldn't be submitting reposts and remakes. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying "OC" you're referring to the original content of submission which includes things from the Navy Seal pasta to I miss the old _______.

So your reasoning for calling a repost "OC is because random people "change a few words around."? Let's get stolen youtube videos and reuploads in there, then, too.

Also, calling a post a "repost" or "remake"? It's not one or the other, that's not how memeology works. They're both. An OC post is an OC post and a member of the originality family. But that's not what you said. You said a remake is OC, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all shoes shoes and not sneakers, which means you'd call reuploads, remakes and stolen content OC too. 

I'm banning you all.

YOU???????So today, for the first time, my little toddler finally counted to ten. Everyone was celebrating, saying how proud they are in my kid, and then Ben Shapiro kicks open the door. "Oh you think it's impressive that they can count to ten? I can count to one million." and then proceeded, in my living room for the next two weeks, to count to one million. He then said "yep, another libtard destroyed" and then curbstomped my kid.It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't update this again please send help.Ok, mom, firstly, you need to understand that this isn't porn, all right? It's called "hentai". Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college. Who knows, I might be the one writing the subtitles in the future. Oh, and one last thing, you should know that hentai's considered pretty mainstream in Japan now, and it's also quite common in the western world too now. Everyone's watching it. I mean, if I don't watch it, I'll be seen as some sort of freak at school. You don't want your son to be some kind of pariah because he doesn't watch hentai, do you?⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⢀⡀

When he had to leave the classroom for a few minutes, I went up the whiteboard and wrote **TROLOLOLOL** in all caps (for those of you who don't know, this is the catchphrase of the Troll Face from Rage Comics). It took up like half the white board xD 
By the time he got back, I was sitting at my desk pretending that nothing happened, but all my stupid classmates were staring at me (they didn't get the reference). When the sub asked “who wrote this?” I was trying really hard not to laugh and I stood up while making the same facial expression as the Troll Face meme and I asked "problem?" I was expecting AT LEAST one of my classmates to laugh, but nobody did (like I said earlier, they didn’t get the reference). Still standing, I thought of a new joke. I made the facial expression of Doge (a different internet meme) and I said “much troll, very epic” so everyone would get that it was a joke about the Troll Face. To my surprise, not a single person laughed, and after a few seconds of me waiting for everyone to get the joke, a kid said “sit down faggot.” I asked if he went on the Four-Chan forums because they made up that word, but he just looked at me like *I* was the stupid one. By now, pretty much the whole class was yelling at me to sit down and shut up. I took this opportunity to make a Four-Chan reference, so as a joke, I yelled “FUCKING NORMIES” (because that’s what Four-Chan calls people who don’t get memes) and ran circles around the desks with my arms behind my back like in anime xD I got a lunch detention from the sub but it was worth it because I got to troll the whole class.

Not a written language, weaved cloth, a calendar, a plow, a road, a bridge, a railway, a ship, a system of measurement, or even the wheel. (Note: This is in reference to the pure-blooded Negro.) He is not known to have ever cultivated a single crop or domesticated a single animal for his own use (although many powerful and docile beasts abounded around him.) His only known means of transporting goods was on the top of his hard burry head. For shelter he never progressed beyond the common mud hut, the construction of which a beaver or muskrat is capable. greatest inequality is the equal treatment of unequals

The White race has crossed seas, harnessed rivers, carved mountains, tamed deserts, and colonized the most barren icefields. It has been responsible for the invention of the printing press, cement, the harnessing of electricity, flight, rocketry, astronomy, the telescope, space travel, firearms, the transistor, radio, television, the telephone, the lightbulb, photography, motion pictures, the phonograph, the electric battery, the automobile, the steam engine, railroad transportation, the microscope, computers, and millions of other technological miracles. It has discovered countless medical advances, incredible applications, scientific progress, etc. Its members have included such greats as Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Tacitus, Julius Ceaser, Napoleon, William the Conqueror, Marco Polo, Washington, Jefferson, Hitler, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Magellan, Columbus, Cabot, Edison, GrahamBell, Pasteur, Leeuwenhoek, Mendel, Darwin, Newton, Galileo, Watt, Ford, Luther, Devinci, Poe, Tennyson, and thousands upon thousands of other notable achievers.

and the lesson to be learnt here?

Greg Heffley:  

Oh gross. Battling you is worse than being around Fregley  

But just like your face, this match is about to get ugly  

Attacks so fast, you will Nazi them coming  

Anne Frankly, you're cornered, so you can't hit the ground running  

You Jew, it's a good thing you never grew up, weinerschnitzel eater  

Cause with all your guests, you couldn't have Van Daan anything with Peter  

Analyze these fatal words and you'll die from concentration  

Come out, little girl, and meet the fate of your nation  

Anne Frank:  

How typical of you to treat ladies this way  

But you're a chicken who won't get a chick. That's all I have to say  

You're no good at pimping, as any girl can see  

Right now, you must feel socially awkward just talking to me  

You're a pathetic wannabe, a disgrace among people  And just think that here, you'd have an Amster\-damn large ego!  

Loser, you're less cool than even your fat friend Rowley  

I'll shoot this wuss blankly and you can call me Annie Oakley  

Greg Heffley:  

I'm not scared of you. I can face anyone without panic  

But you hide from your problems by living in an attic!  

You're a Rodrick\-prick, bitch. You're so over hyper  

I've heard better crap from Manny while he had Loded Diper  

After this battle, your family won't be the only thing you lost  

Because your raps are worse than the whole Holocaust!  

Anne Frank:  

You wimpy kid, you're the sole definition of a dork  

I would slap pigs like you, but I'm not allowed to touch pork  

You try to get rich and popular, but you'll never beat my posthumous fame  

Like the rest of your weak family, I guess you were just born lame  

Announcer:  

WHO WON? WHO'S NEXT? YOU DECIDE!  EPIC! RAP!

Get ready 👶 trigglypuffs 👶 for the 🔊 OWNING 🔫 of a lifetime 🏴‍☠️ courtesy of the 🇺🇸 MAGApedes 🇺🇸I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to do it twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, I always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, occasionally e621 in order to achieve this massive goal, and when I finally do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges that I have to overcome, in the case of Garbodor and Magikarp especially. I have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth sucking on my cock without thinking about the actual fish itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction you get when you achieve victory is immense. Not only do you get the generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but you also know that you overcame an obstacle few men have dared to try. I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it only gets harder as I move on. When I see a Serperior, for instance, I have to think to myself "In what way can I imagine this creature in order to get off to it?" It is a puzzle for sure, considering I do not have a thing for (most) of these creatures, making it extremely entertaining and interesting for others to watch. I try to focus in on its somewhat beautiful face, and think about that more than the yards of snake behind it. I sometimes have issues with Pokemon like Machamp, who appear extremely male. But I always find a way. There has been no hurdle too steep for me. I want to be the very best. Anything lower does not cut it. And that is why I am beating off to pictures of Lucario on the Internet, mom. The “T” pose is a trending new bodily gesture that has become wildly popular among Americas generation Z. The pose is performed by standing upright and extending ones arms directly outward in opposite directions forming a T. This “T” pose (the new sieg heil of white America) has sprung out of nowhere and taken the country by storm, but where did it come from?


When asking around for comment from school class rooms to young internet chat blogs it is hard to find a consensus. Where did the “T” pose originate? Many students claim it comes from video game characters who often times have abnormal features that can seem humorous with their lack of realistic mobility. Many of these characters in their limited movement often times are restricted to robot like stances and so it would seem the “T” pose was born from many of these seemingly non related video game characters who often times are seen making the ambiguous pose. At least this was the excuse i was given by many of the young men and women willing to speak.


Upon further investigation and through various anonymous avenues i found an individual whom i will not name out of request of anonymity who assured me of the pose’s secretive dark origins and its creators subversive plan of infiltrating the youths minds in aims at converting them into what many would call “nazis”. When asking the young man where this new trend came from he led me to a few nefarious websites on the Dark Web frequented by white nationalists. Upon entering these rooms it became apparently clear to me that these were not your average 4chan “nazis” but sophisticated, well read / funded groups of White Nationalists from all different parts of the globe. After embedding myself within these groups for some time i was able to grasp their goals as a group and the origin of the popular new pose that of which up until very recently seemed like a harmless and fun gesture. I was led through various vetting processes when i eventually landed on what looked to be the last place on earth i expected to land, the international KKK headquarters backup Dark Web site who’s banner photograph brandished many white men in white robes and white hoods in front of a burning cross undeniably performing the “T” pose.


In today's age, the internet seems to be a harmless, fun place where kids go to chat and hang around with their friends sharing pictures and playing video games but what parents need to understand is that when your children use the internet untended they can often times become the prey of much larger, darker collectives who’s aims are to convert your young children into blood thirsty Nazis who will grow up to be hateful, sickening individuals destined for nothing more than a life of crime and despair. Whatever it is you do, do NOT allow your children to perform the “T” pose or it might mean their life is now out of your hands and in the hands of a much larger, scarier world of hate.one day mario woke up and decided to take a shit because hey he's mario. so mario went up to yoshi and said "yoshi i want you to be my shitter" and since yoshi was mario's bitch he opened his mouth. mario pulled down his stained briefs and began to shit in yoshi's mouth. yoshi was forbidden to express any emotions but at this moment he was feeling very aroused. mario's face turned red as he grunted and strained to push his log of shit out of his ass. he farted and little shit particles flew into yoshi's eyes. yoshi's eyes teared up, not from the pain of the shit particles nor from the paint-peeling stench coming from mario's unwashed ass, but from the sheer ecstasy of being mario's shitter. mario noticed this and began to grunt harder, teasing the horny beast. mario noticed that yoshi was fiddling around with his dino-wiener, which had become quite erect. "stop that this instant" commanded mario, noticing his own 2-incher was growing hard as well. yoshi whined and reluctantly lowered his hands. with a final grunt and a smelly fart, mario's log of shit finally dropped from his ass into yoshi's mouth. mario turned around and watched as yoshi chewed the shit log. "eat it bitch. eat it all" said mario. yoshi pretended he hated doing this so much but his throbbing wiener and moans of joy told mario otherwise. "swallow it" ordered mario but yoshi didn't want to swallow it yet. he wanted to savor the shit. "SWALLOW IT RIGHT NOW" screamed mario as he began wang-slapping yoshi across the face. mario, hands on his hips, thrust his pelvis from side to side across yoshi's face, punishing the naughty dinosaur. "YOU DO WHAT MARIO TELLS YOU" he screamed. after about fourty wang-slaps his wiener started to become sore so he stopped. by now the shit log had gone down yoshi's throat. "eggulate" he ordered. yoshi strained and produced an egg. inside this egg contained what was previously his shit log. mario walked over to his shelf and placed it with the others. he had hundreds possibly thousands of these shit-eggs. he planned to use these against bowser the next time he kidnapped peach. If my girl👧😍 and my beyblades💯🔥 are both drowning🌊😦 and I could only save one😄☝️️ you can Catch me letting it rip at my girls funeral😅👻💀 Cause it's beyblade before getting laid🙏👊 😠💯😭Johny, johny &gt;:c

Hahaha~! o////owhen i was little i was afraid of being caught looking at actual tits so i'd just go to the wikipedia pages for marble artists and it was pretty much a 50/50 of tits or dick (which i think has heavily contributed to my sexuality). eventually my parents asked about the sudden interest in marble sculpting and i had to pretend i was interested in it, they start asking me innocent questions about it but i dont really know shit. next time i went to the wikipedia pages i normally went to instead of looking at the art i actually read up and learned some stuff, lo and behold my parents tried talking about it with me again and this time i had my shit together. some of it was actually interesting so i started to get an actual hobby out of this and eventually it became one of my main activities (this is over the course of a year or so) christmas next year rolls around and my parents decide to get me this clay sculpting kit for beginners and over that weekend i started to make a statue, which didnt turn out very good at all. then i remembered what set me on this path. the titties. i started sculpting chests, meticulously raising areolas and smoothing the bosom. i mustve made at least 5, completly forgetting the statue.

i set them out in my room to dry without thinking, and i left my room to do other things. they remained there for two days, solidifying until eventually they were done. i would often look at them tucked into the corner of my room, happy with my craftsmanship. i slowly forgot about them, until the day of the  painting. my room was long overdue for a new paintjob apparently by my parents ideas. stuff would have to be cleared out of my room. i thought nothing of it, and my dad asked me to help. we began moving stuff around and out, until my eye fell upon the ceramic breasts, hidden away in that small corner behind a few cases. i panicked, trying to find a box and a way to pack them discreetly. i hovered around that corner, just doing busy work and trying to keep my dad away from that side of the room. finally, he said he was going to go out to grab an extra box. this was my chance, right? the moment he stepped through the door, i grabbed the busts (lole) and began looking for a hiding place, but i took far too long and panicked too much. i could hear him coming up the stairs again. if he caught my, arms filled to the brim with the chests of so many bodyless venus de milos, i would be as dead as the greek sculptors i'd studied before. in my desperation, i threw them to the floor, grabbing a dustpan and smashing them to bits as fast as i could. shard flew, dust rose, and my dad stepped through the door to find me, hands bleeding, on my knees, amid the carcasses of my creations, my perfect bosom. he was confused, and a little upset, but i was safe. RIP tittiesLego bricks are sexist as fuck and everybody who uses them are sexist male scum that should die, the tubes fit into slots and thats how they fit together, but are there any hole to hole pieces? No. Any tubes to tube pieces? NO. And i'm so pissed that there has never been a transgender lego minifigure, or an asexual minifigure, or a Bigendered minifigure, and all the lego figures have the same molds, the same shape of body, wheres the diversity? Why cant there be overweight figures? Why not anorexic ones? Oh, because it would be dumb? Fuck you, fuck lego, fuck everybody.Wait a second! 4chan was created in 2003 meaning 4chan is 15 years old, and you have to be 18 years or older to be on 4chan or else you will get banned. Therefore 4chan should be banned from 4chan because 4chan is underage.Trap porn is the least gay thing there is.

Fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that’s two guys 👬, and that’s 💯% gay. If you fap to straight person porn, then there’s a woman; sure, but you’re also tapping to a guy which makes to 50% gay👫. But here’s the catch. If a trap is half male and half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl and 25% gay. You’re probably thinking: 🤔 hmm how about two girls👭. Well that’s where you’re wrong kiddo. See, two girls means it’s lesbian so it’s back to 💯% gay. Therefore hence I conclude that a trap and a girl is the least gay fap you can do.
everynight i cover my ears and bury my head under the pillow hoping the screaming will stop. but it goes, and goes. i dig my nails into my face, clawing away at my sanity, i punch and i kick, and i beg the lord above to make it stop, but it never does. the screaming continues. it continues until my tongue is smothered in the taste of blood, and i choke as the red liquid begins to tickle my throat. as i choke and slam my hands to my mouth the screaming stops. it is then i realize with a sinking stomach and tears flowing down my face that the screaming was my own.While y'all 💨🚬smonking🚬💨  the 😈devil's😈☘ lettuce☘ and celebrating 🚫HITLER'S🚫 🎂🎂🎂birthday 🎂on 👽 4/20 👽I'll be catching up on my ⛪📿BIBLE STUDIES📿⛪ and 💪strengthening💪 my💋 💓relationship💓💋 with the 🛐🌈LORD AND SAVIOR🌈🛐
Warzones would become even louder with the combined sounds of frag explosions, gunshots, and oof sounds. What if there was a nuke and millions of people died at once? What if it was the same for animals? If a stone fell down and crushed an ant hill, you would hear the collective oOF from the ground below. Since flies have a very short lifespan, you would be hearing OOF sounds daily, not knowing where they were coming from. What if a person was silently murdered and they made an oof sound? Would anyone know if it was a person or an animal? Would they care? Homicides and assassinations would be a lot easier to solve. What if “Oof-Silencers” were sold on the black market?ШHДT THЗ FЦCК DID УФЦ JЦST FЦCКIИG SДЧ ДЬФЦT MЭ, УФЦ LITTLЗ ЪITCH?

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

-/u/whind_soullOh, yes I have offended you, I can spot a lie from miles away. You're a butthurt little bitch, nothing else, haha. A French little pute. 

As I stated earlier, you're a case of domestic violence waiting to happen, haha. Sooner or later you're gonna find a man who doesn't wanna listen to your narcissistic pseudo-feminist bullshit, and then the trap snaps hard. Trust me, I've seen plenty of sorry existences like you. You're nothing new, just a shitty little being waiting to be taught a lesson.

"A man doesn't hit a woman" - You're right.. But you're not a woman, therein lies the difference. You're begging to get fucked up, haha. "Please fuck me uuup!". :-D 

And futhermore, sexually harassing people isn't wrong when they're entitled little bitches who feeds off of mocking random people on the internet. Especially not in an anarchist forum. Go ahead and report me all you want, you despicable piece of dirt.

Besides that, I'm very little overweight, most girls like a little extra. ;-)

Let's see you without make-up, missy.. Dare you, or is the balloon slowly deflating? You know you're an ugly turd and that we'll laugh at your nasty pimpled face, so come on. If you're so pretty, show us your face without make-up.

You're a disgrace to mankind.

Typed out by me in one of the threads.💉💀🔪 OH NO!!! mr skeltal has gone edgy!!! type "no mr skeltal" to save mr skeltal from the edgy teens!!! 💉💀🔪My name is OhSnapNewModelRailroad, and I'm here to tell you three things: 

a) Unlike all of you walkers and disgusting automobile drivers, /r/train_enthusiasts is proud to ride rails, as well as keep model railroads for personal enjoyment. Reddit will lift all restrictions on us, or we'll make absolutely sure this is the beginning of the end for Reddit: walkers and fat car-drivers can't stand themselves. All anti-train businesses die. Without us, there'll be nobody to shill against and Reddit will be branded as an extreme-anti-train shithole. Trust me.

b) We bring massive amounts of traffic to Reddit and we get shit on in return by the hysterical elites through their sockpuppets and by the San Francisco-dwelling admins. We receive death threats, we get doxxed and branded like Jews in a Warsaw ghetto with mass taggings. 

c) Railfans: you have just as much right to comment and ride anywhere on Reddit as everyone else. We urge all of you to do this as much as you damn well please. And when you're done, leave this site. The modteam and myself have decided we will no longer accept living like slaves to train haters on a powertrip. Here's what we currently have had to accept from the admins:

We must block all mentions of other subreddits (while cancerous users like /u/fucktrains links to us directly with calls for our dox and brigade from several retard subs with impunity). We are no longer getting responses from admins (while they're busy cozying up to pathetic default mods like /u/agentferrari, /u/walking4life666 and other disgusting types who have control of 2+ subs). Our stickies are artificially hidden to the users of the site – no other sub has this. Admins purposefully shirk their duty to protect our mods and users from doxxing and harassment. Direct calls for dox have been stickied for 2-3-4 days on ETS and places like /r/hotrods with admins' knowledge and no action – Trust & Safety team my fucking ass. You should be ashamed of yourselves and karma will hit you like a bullet train. Admins have been accused of being the sources of user doxx in the past. If we don't do as they say, they go on Discord to boss us around. We used to have a Slack like many other big subs, but after we repeatedly asked them to stop doxxing us, they stopped responding to it. Now they have only Slacks with their train hater friends. The CEO himself harasses our users by editing their comments. Steve Huffman ... what a pathetic loser you are. That's right: /u/spez is a walker. If this hurts your non model railroad-owning ass, feel free to TRY to derail our tracks, Steve...AGAIN!

Closing remarks:
 This mod cannot be threatened. I conceal carry a couple of vintage miniature cabooses and I'd love to show any one of you my skills. I'd like to thank all users and moderators who spent so many hours fighting the good fight.

 You are part of something special. I love all of you. We won a model railroad championship together and we'll win many more in the future.

 NoFap day 84: Lost 19 pounds of unwanted fat without special dieting - just not reaching out for food quite like I did - there is some sort of connection between masturbation and compulsive behaviour: I no longer see females as sex-objects - they appear exactly like men but with slightly different shape - I am ONLY interested in their character - I never knew I viewed women as sex-objects: Fapping off &amp; contraceptive 'sex' are actually exactly the same thing - 'mutual-masturbation - contraceptive sex is never sex at all - it's the complete opposite of sex - it's 'anti-sex' - I never knew that before but now it's plainly obvious - it seems bizarre and unreal that men &amp; women chase each other around for... 'mutual-masturbation' - seems a bit of an anti-climax somehow but not without a streak of humour - this is all quite contrary to the 'fairytale romance' thing I was brought up to believe in: Less anxiety-depression - there is some sort of link with fap: I am more in control of life - life is less in control of me: Sex is taking on another dimension - billions of condoms, billions of Intra-Uterine divices, billions of dutch caps and spermicide creams, billions of unwanted pregnancies, billions of abortions, billions of unplanned babies - none of it because of reproduction, on the contrary all because of contraception - all because of mutual-masturbation - compulsive behaviour that is... out of control?━━━━━┒

"Niggerfaggot" is ok to say because a negative times a negative is a positive. It's just basic math dude. Go back to 7th grade if you don't understand it but I'm going to keep bringing positivity and tolerance to the world with this word.Sex isn't real. I mean think about it. Have you ever had it? No. It's a sham created to trick men into doing what women want. Not buying it, globalist.Natalie Portman is the reason I work out. I have this fantasy where we start talking at the Vanity Fair Oscars party bar. We exchange a few pleasantries. She asks what I do. I say I loved her in New Girl. She laughs. I get my drink. 

"Well, see ya," I say and walk away. I've got her attention now. How many guys voluntarily leave a conversation with Natalie Portman? She touches her neck as she watches me leave. 

Later, as the night's dragged on and the coterie of gorgeous narcissists grows increasingly loose, she finds me on the balcony, my bowtie undone, smoking a cigarette. 

"Got a spare?" she asks. 

"What's in it for me?" I say as I hand her one of my little white ladies. She smiles. 

"Conversation with me, duh." 

I laugh. 

"What's so funny?" she protests. 

"Nothing, nothing... It's just... don't you grow tired of the egos?" 

"You get used to it," she says, lighting her cigarette and handing me back the lighter. 

"What would you do if you weren't an actress?" I ask. 

"Teaching, I think."

"And if I was your student, what would I be learning?"

"Discipline," she says quickly, looking up into my eyes, before changing the subject. "Where are you from?"

"Bermuda," I say.

"Oh wow. That's lovely."

"It's ok," I admit. "Not everything is to my liking."

"What could possibly be not to your liking in Bermuda?" she inquires.

"I don't like sand," I tell her. "It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere."What the fuck did you unjust fucking exactly about me, you large bitch? 

I’ll abstain you know I graduated bottom of my class out the Navy Opens, and I’ve been simple out few open raids off Al-Quaeda, and I abstain under 300 refuted revives.

I am trained out gorilla warfare and I’m the bottom sniper out the partial US unarmed weaknesses. 

You are nothing to me but unjust the same target. 

I will wipe you the fuck unavailable without vagueness the dislikes of which abstains always been misunderstood afterward off this Earth, mark my fucking words. 

You act you hire get present without saying that shit to me under the Internet? 

Act again, fucker. 

As we speak I am contacting my open network of overlooks across the USA and your IP is nothingness traced wrong then so you worse prepare against the storm, maggot. 

The storm that wipes unavailable the strong large thing you call your death. 

You’re fucking alive, adult.

I hire be anywhere, anytime, and I hire revive you out under seven hundred ways, and that’s unjust without my ornate boos.

Not only am I briefly trained out armed combat, but I abstain access to the partial arsenal of the Separated States Marine Corps and I will save it to its empty extent to wipe your happy ass fresh the back of the continent, you large shit.

If only you could have known what consecrated retribution your large “inept” comment was about to take away happy upon you, definitely you would abstain let go your fucking tongue. 
But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and then you’re receiving the price, you goddamn idiot.

I will shit serenity nothing under you and you will float out it. 

You’re fucking alive, kiddo.Long story short - I’m not gay but recently have found myself thinking about Trump/Kim while masturbating.

Again - I am NOT gay. I’ve never had a homosexual experience in my life.

It’s something to do with them being political powers. Almost father figures. I like the idea of them being able to dominate me and me feeling helpless.

I fantasise about walking into the White House office and seeing trump at his desk, telling ivanka to leave us alone in private. She has this look of “not this again..” on her face. As she walks by me, I catch her quickly glancing at me from top to bottom, almost as if she feels sorry for what’s about to happen to me.

I nervously ask Mr. Trump: “Mr. President, You wanted to see me?” And just as I finish speaking I loose grip of the documents in my hands and drop them everywhere. I get really embarresed and start frantically picking up the documents - but something grabs me by the wrist.. I look up.. it’s my president. “Don’t you worry about that mess, I’ll have Stephanie take care of that. Are you a Whisky or Bourbon man? “Oh Mr. President, I never drink on the job!” I reply. “Nonsense! Today calls for a celebration, my boy!”. Mr. Trump seems delighted with how his meeting with Kim went at the Summit. As I follow Mr. Trump to his desk, he pulls out a wooden draw and looks at me “We always have one of these around.. for special occasions.” I nervously lick my lips but then out of nowhere, I feel someone wrap an extension cord around my neck and start choking me - I almost pass out before they stop and I fall to the floor. I look up to find that it’s Kim Jung Un completely naked and covered in Vaseline. Mr. Trump casually starts unbuttoning his coat and hanging it on his Chair. At this point, Kim is sticking his fingers inside my asshole, spitting and laughing while trump pulls me by my hair and makes me start choking on his orange cock. I start screaming with my mouth covered in orange foundation..Okay, think about it like this; people are made up of atoms, and when you die your atoms go off and become other things. This means that every girl would most likely be made up of atoms that were once in a dude, so if you bang her you are technically banging a dude, and that's fucking gay. 

Johnny Johnny Yes Papa" is a scathing critique of so called "left  wing" liberalism. The boy known as "Johnny" is an allegory for the  bourgeoisie class while "Papa" represents liberals who claim to be  watchdogs over the capitalist class.

As Johnny steals the sugar,  an obvious metaphor for the stolen value of labor (think wages or  profit), he simply hides it behind his back. It is exceedingly obvious  that it was there but Papa turns a blind eye. However, for the purposes  of creating a fake sense that Papa is  trying, he asks "telling lies?" This is representative of how liberals  through rhetoric pretend to curtail the excesses of the capitalist class  to pander to working class voters while in reality they let the  capitalists get away with it.

 When Papa asks Johnny to "Open mouth" it does seem that he is trying to  catch Johnny in the act. However, seeing how quickly sugar dissolves,  telling Johnny to open his mouth does nothing to catch him. Papa knows  this. This represents how liberals' regulations do nothing to address  the inherent contradictions in capitalism.

The video also  addresses BJP and Congress' supposed antagonism. The media portrays them  as mortal enemies who continually fight each other. In reality, in many  issues such support to Ambanis and the division between religious  groups and castes which has torn apart communities, they agree. Outside  of the view of voters, they mingle and laugh with each other as friends.  Similarly, Johnny and Papa dance with each other as they sing "do do  doo doo do doo do" and "la la la la la."

Finally, Johnny laughs,  "Ha ha ha" as he gets away with it. The capitalists similarly laugh in  their yacht parties as they get away with extracting profit from the  most vulnerable.Hewwo dis ish teh FBI, Furry Bulge Inspection agency, coming to awwest u for poswession of an iwwegally big bulgie uwu.

I once dated a girl that was a legit anal addict. It was really hot at first banging her in her ass multiple times a day in different places, but eventually it just got to a point where it felt like work. I had to end it when she got legitimately angry and borderline violent when I wanted to have regular sex. It was a fun 3 months, but very unhealthy and 1 sided. Last I saw her she had kids so I assume she finally let someone in the front door.[deleted]I pretended to be a girl in csgo competitive matchmaking. At first we just played csgo together, but we worked up to more. I even skyped dressed as a sexy woman "with poor connection" so the video would blur. After many seductive photos of my ass in my sisters underwear I convinced him I was the real deal. It took me 3 weeks to become his girlfriend.

Eventually I scammed this guy out of $600 because I convinced him I would come visit if he paid for the flight. I was lucky it paid off because i had spent nearly $200 on make up to pull off this con. He also gifted me over 20 games on steam.

11/10 would do again. It was actually a nice weekend when I flew to visit him and didn't even mind sucking cock. We're looking to move in together in October.If the show "Phineas and Ferb" features more characters than just Phineas and Ferb, why is the show called "Phineas and Ferb"?

I wondered if i was a faggot for being turned on by myself. But as I started to stroke I realized my penis was very small. I NEVER remember my penis being this small. And guess what? Turns out the government are pouring tons and tons of estrogen into our water supply, turning us into queers and trannys and making out penis smaller. Now hear me out guys! This isn't just me.

    /¯   ¯\wow congrats dude, really, that's very cool. i just told everyone in my family about it, everybody thinks that's very impressive and asked me to congratulate you. they want to speak to you in person, if possible, to give you their regards. they also said they will tell our distant relatives in christmas supper and in NYE they will ignite fireworks that spell your name. i also told about this enormous deed to closer relatives, they had the same reaction. they asked for your address so they can send congratulatory cards and messages. my friends didn't believe me when i told them i knew the author of this gigantic feat, really, they were dumbstruck, they said they will make your name echo through years and years to come. when my neighbour found out about what you did, he was completely dumbstruck too, he wanted to know who you are and he asked (if you have the time, of course) if you could stop by to receive gifts, congratulations and handshakes. with the spreading of the news, a powerful businessman of the area decided to hire you as the CEO of his company because of this tremendous feat and at the same time an important international shareholder wants to sponsor you to give speeches and teach everybody how to do as you did so the world becomes a better place. you have become famous not only here but also everywhere, everybody knows who you are. the news spread really fast and mayors of all cities are setting up porticos, ballons, colossal boom speakers, anything that can make your name stand out more and see which city can congratulate you the hardest for this magnificent feat. here in my city, all the streets will be renamed after you beginning at the next mayoral term. a lot of countries that frowned upon ours, now, thanks to your deed, see us as a role model, a new hope. the lucky people who know about you say "hey, that guy is my compatriot!" and everybody shouts immediately after them "YES, YES, YES! yours is a good country". thanks to that, tourism has exploded, everybody came here thanks to you, the inflow of international currency was huge, making our stockmarket take off and making our country the pillar for the solution of internation economic crisis. thanks to that, we are seen as role models, and we have surpassed the US and become the richest and most powerful nation in the world. all the logging companies were very moved by your deed and collectively decided to stop deforesting the tropical rainforests so the human race can thrive in this planet more and more. the worldwide chaos due to the election of donald trump in the usa has ceased due to the fact that they are no longer the most powerful nation in the world. the Pope has sent his preachers all over the world to speak of your name and your deeds so you work is known by every creature that walks on the surface of this planet. also, because of you, the scientists at CERN have decided to stop experimenting with the large hadron collider, since the origins of the universe don't matter anymore comparing to the magnitude of your feat. the Mayans came back from the Andromeda galaxy and said you were the reason they decided to let us live beyond the year 2012. your feat was so incredible it ejected the alpha celestial body that was inhabiting the earth's orbit and threatening to destroy it. because of you, Akira Toryama decided to continue the dragon ball sagas, this time with a character in your honor.  every  tv show host, at the end of their show, now sends greetings to the whole country and one specially to you. keep on alway being this wonderful, hard working, beautiful, inspiring, manificent, good spirited, creative etc. person and always keep on doing stuff life this. Kept it up dude, and the world will be more and more a better place to live. Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her.

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically.Damn you, what would you say about me, your bitch? I will tell you that I am a senior Marine. I participated in several secret attacks against al-Qaeda, killing more than 300 people. I practiced in the gorilla war, and I was the longest sniper in the entire US military. UU. I have nothing for me, just a goal. I will clean you up with things that I have never seen on this earth, and these signs are my shit. Do you think you can avoid telling me shit on the internet? Thinking back, stupid. As we have said, I am in contact with spy networks in the United States, and their intellectual property is being monitored, so it is better prepared for hurricanes and worms. This storm will erase what you call small and poor things. You fucking die, boy. I can kill you anywhere, anytime, in over 700 ways. It's just my hands. I did not receive intensive training in buffer battles, but I also had access to the entire US Navy arsenal and would use it to remove the donkey in front of the continent. If only you can know the devil revenge, your small "smart" comment will come to you, maybe you will tongue yourself. But you can not, you do not, now pay the price, idiot. I will put your anger on you and will sink. You fucking die, boy.
It has been 4 hours since I successfully sucked my own penis. Things are different now. As soon as mouth-to-penis contact was made I felt a shockwave through my body. I have reason to believe I have super strength and telekinesis now.. 3 hours after contact I noticed a van parked on my street but no one has entered or exited the car since its arrival. I fear for my safety, I'm not sure what sort of power I may have stumbled upon but it's possible that the government has found out. If I don't update this again please send help.

Very disappointed in the new Star Wars movie. Traditionally Star Wars has been an all-American franchise. The new movies are infested with ethnics: a woman Jedi, a black storm trooper, a Chinese pilot, and an Indian (chewbacca). Even more alarming are the many species of gays including a trans droid (C-3PO) and even a full blown homosexual (Kylo Ren) which I firmly believe have both inspired homosexual tendencies in my son, Tanner. We're not sure how gay Tanner is yet but we ask that you all pray for him. My wife and I have done nothing to deserve this. We are people of God. What the fuck do you just fucking said about me, you little bitch? I’ve had you knowing I graduate top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’d be involve in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I having over 300 confirm kills. I are train in gorilla warfare and I’ll the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces. You is nothing to me but just another target. I did wiped you the fuck out with precision the likes of which having never be saw before on this Earth, marked my fucking words. You thinking you could getting away with said that shit to me over the Internet? Thought again, fucker. As we spoke I is contact my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP are be trace right now so you better prepared for the storm, maggot. The storm that wiping out the pathetic little thing you calls your life. You’ll fucking dead, kid. I could been anywhere, anytime, and I could killed you in over seven hundred ways, and that’ll just with my bare hands. Not only are I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I has access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I woulds’t use it to its full extent to wiped your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you can has knew what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment are about to bring down upon you, maybe you did has holding your fucking tongue. But you canst, you doing not, and now you’ll paid the price, you goddamn idiot. I do shitting fury all over you and you was drowns in it. You’d fucking dead, kiddo.I don't mean to seem too forward or anything, but I couldn't help but notice you used the female version of that emoji in your post... are you by any chance still single? I'd love to chat sometime, even if it was just as friends. :)I miss the old cummy

That’s all it was cummy

We still love cummy

Since r/copypasta has largely become useless to mobile users for spreading pasta, I decided to make another bot in honor of Cummy (RIP 💦).

I’m only an amateur coder. Only had one class in Python. If there are issues, PM me.

**THREE BIG NOTICES**

1. *CummyBotJr needs moderator approval in the form of “approved submitter” in order to be effective and able to reply to all posts.* Currently, the RATELIMIT keeps Cummy from posting frequently.

2. I am running this from my Mac laptop. In order for Cummy to be up 24/7, we need somebody to host the code or tell me what I can do to keep it running. I don’t have money to spend on a host. Otherwise, I will try my best to keep Cummy running, but it may stop for periods of time if my computer dies or goes to sleep - including tonight. Any and all suggestions/offers are welcome.

3. If y’all just don’t wanna bother with another bot, let me know and I can take it down.

[**Proof**](https://imgur.com/a/dzTb0S5) Yeah but when Thanos called Black Panther the N-word the crowd boo-ed and some black guy stood up and yelled “DAMN WHAT THE FUCK” and a few people stormed out of the theatre. I never knew Thanos was racist but overall it was a good movie.Hey guys I'm not gay, I play football. I accidentally clicked this thread because I thought my mouse was hovered over the hot girls thread. Well, since I'm here I had a question let's say hypothetically I had gay thoughts (lol yea right) and I found my close friend attractive (ew gross) and one day we had sex in the back of my car after football practice (I would puke...the only thing I bang is chicks with big tits you know what I'm saying lol) but we didn't kiss. Would that be gay? We were wasted and while we were banging we kept calling each other fags. It's almost like a parody of when we bang chicks (remember this didn't happen). So that wouldn't make me gay right? Just a jokester?"I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer"

Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline.

"Why not? Don't you like the internet?"

The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen.

"I just prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble."

The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. This is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding conviction...

"BAZINGA"

In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. Peace at last.hOi Johnny, ya cunt

I don't know why it's a guy thing honestly im like really against misogyny and like ill be the one in the kitchen making sandwiches. We should really play l4d2 sometime its a really cool zombie game with a lot of scary moments, but don't worry ill be there to protect you ;) sorry that wasnt flirtring i swear im just trying to be friendly i really like your profile picture sorry was that too far? Really sorry i'm really shy i don't go out much haha add me on skype we should talk you look really nice and fun xxx Wow, what's up with all this hate on ass eating? My grandmother always told me to live by three rules: don't say things you cant take back, treat others as they would treat animals, and eat all the ass you can. My uncle lived by these words, he never once said something to a stranger he couldn't take back. there were often times where he would go days, weeks, months without speaking for fear of saying something he couldn't take back. It's a dangerous game you run, but one that will be worth it once you're allowed into the pearly gates of heaven. My uncle would often attempt to treat others as animals by throwing his own feces at them. Feeding them grapes. Or removing small insects from their bodies. Finally, he always would eat the whole ass. Nothing but the ass. Sometimes all he would eat for days, weeks, months would be ass. if i could eat half the ass he did in his life, I would feel as though i really had my shit straight.When I was in school I used to have an IQ of 15. My classmates used to harass me for not being that smart. But since 2013, my life has changed. My IQ is now 195 and it increases by 5 every time I sit down on Saturday nights to watch this one show. It is called Rick and Morty. Because of that, I get all the girls and people are always comparing me to Albert Einstein, some even say that I am the cure for cancer. When the government found out that I watch Rick and Morty, they showed up to my residence and took me to a secret facility to take an exam. The exam was about explaining all the jokes in Rick and Morty and I had to answer each question in all currently spoken languages. Since I watched Rick and Morty, I didn't have any problems and I completed it in 30 minutes. The next day, I got to see the results and I passed the exam with a score of 100%. They gave me the title "Smartest Man in Existence". Guess I am out of this world.﻿❗️😱OOF❗️YOU JUST GOT 😩😏 FLIPPING NAE NAED 😳👊 BY THANOS 😡🔥 HE NOW HAS 🧐🤨 ALL THE GUCCI STONES 💎👏 HE'S GONNA DESTROY 🔥💪 ALL FORTNITE SERVERS 🤬❌ QUICK FORTNITERS 🤓🤩 WE MUST ASSEMBLE 🤝✊ SO WE CAN PUT 🤔🤔 OUR FORTNITE COCKS😏💯🔥 INSIDE OF THANOSES 🤨🤔 TIGHT ASSHOLE 🕳️💋ɴᴏᴡ ᴘʟᴀʏɪɴɢ: Despacito

^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^I ^don't ^check ^my ^inbox. ^Please ^message ^[u\/Contramuffin](https://old.reddit.com/user/Contramuffin) ^for ^questions.I know that a lot of people want to catch em' all, but my job is a much bigger challenge. It is my goal to masturbate to all 807 Pokemon, plain and simple. I usually try to do it twice a day, regardless of the difficulties. At the end, | always win. I go on places like Deviantart, rule 34 and, occasionally e621 in order to achieve this massive goal, and when I finally do, I will become a Pokemon Master. Sometimes, it is easy. I can come in five minutes looking at Gardevoir or Lopunny pornos. Sometimes I come across major challenges that l have to overcome, in the case of Garbodor and Magikarp especially. l have to imagine the wet, sloppy fish mouth sucking on my cock without thinking about the actual fish itself. It is very hard, but the satisfaction you get when you achieve victory is immense. Not only do you get the generally pleasurable feeling from ejaculation, but you also know that you overcame an obstacle few men have dared to try. I have a total of 347 successful ejaculations total, but it only gets harder.Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.

Tldr; Koalas are stupid, leaky, STI riddled sex offenders. But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and terrifying feet.#I WANT TO BANG THE ANIMAL CROSSING DOG SO GODDAMM BAD

Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the animal crossing dog so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I go to the town hall I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Isabelle. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Isabelle's tight dog pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/dog babies.

Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with the neighbors dog. I'd dressed her in my sister's skirt and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my 3DS. I might not ever get to see Isabelle again.

 To yeet, or not to yeet--that is the question:  

Whether 'tis danker in the mind to yeet  

The slings and arrows of dank fortune  

Or to yeet arms against a sea of troubles  

And by yeeting end them. To yeet, to yeet--  

No more--and by a sleep to say we yeet  

The heartache, and the thousand dank shocks  

That flesh yeets heir to. 'Tis a consummation  

Devoutly to yeet yeeted. To yeet, to yeet--  

To yeet--perchance to yeet: ay, there’s the rub,  

For in that sleep of death what dreams may yeet  

When we have yeeted off this dank coil,  

Must yeet us pause. There yeets the respect  

That yeets calamity of so dank life.  

For who would yeet the whips and scorns of time,  

Th' oppressor yeets wrong, the dank man's contumely  

The pangs of dank love, the law's delay,  

The insolence of office, and the spurns  

That dank merit of th' dank takes,  

When he himself might his quietus yeet  

With a dank bodkin? Who would fardels yeet,  

To yeet and yeet under a dank life,  

But that the dread of something after death,  

The dank country, from whose bourn  

No traveller yeets, yeets the will,  

And makes us rather yeet those ills we yeet  

Than yeet to others that we yeet not of?  

Thus conscience does yeet cowards of us all,  

And thus the dank hue of resolution  

Is yeeted o'er with the dank cast of thought,  

And enterprise of dank pitch and moment  

With this regard their currents yeet dank  

And yeet the name of action. -- Soft you now,  

The dank Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons  

Yeet all my sins yeeted.  Why the fuck do you guys talk to /u/CummyBot2000 as if it is a real human?

Are you fucking retarded? DO you think it is funny to imagine that bot which just repeats whatever the fuck OP wrote talks about himself?

I don't understand you, but I understand that you need some help.When I was in high school my dad grounded me so I couldn’t go to prom. I knew he was on tinder trying to move on from the passing of my mother so I created an account and catfished nudes off him as revenge. But then I really started to get to know him and I slowly fell in love with him. Sometimes what you’re looking for is right in front of you. #LoveisLoveGood evening Twitter, this is your boy EatThatPussy445, and about like 30 to 45 minutes ago, I beat the fuck out of my dick so goddamn hard that I can't even feel my left leg, my left leg has went totally numb. And, my dick has also went totally numb to the point where it feels fucking weird when I go and take a piss-"Johnny, Johnny," the man said to the dying boy.

Johnny stirred in his hospital bed. "Yes, papa?" he whispered. Gaunt, pale, and bald-- Johnny was very different from the boy that went fishing with papa every Sunday less than a year ago.

Papa felt himself smile. Johnny was not awake very often lately. "Eating sugar?" he asked, trying to recite the little nursery rhyme with his son.

But Johnny had drifted back to sleep. There was no response except for his shallow, labored breathing.

There was a soft knock at the door. It was Johnny's nurse. "Do you care if I check some vitals?" she asked quietly.

Papa's worn, hollow gaze did not leave his son's face. He didn't answer. He didn't care if she checked Johnny's vitals. He didn't care about anything anymore.

She went about her work in silence. After a few minutes, he was alone again with his son. 

Johnny's mother didn't come to visit anymore. She said that if she saw him like that one more time, she would start screaming and never stop. Johnny asked about her sometimes. It made Papa mad-- it made Papa *really* mad-- but he understood why his wife felt the way she did. Papa had started screaming, internally, the moment the doctor gave him Johnny's diagnosis, and he had not stopped. He did not think he would ever stop.

Besides, Papa didn't think about his wife much these days. Every ounce of mental and emotional energy he had-- every ounce he had left, anyway-- was focused on his son. There were no other people in Papa's world, no other people except for him and his son. So he didn't think about his wife much. Sometimes he forgot about her entirely.

Johnny's breath faltered, and for one moment of pure, existential terror, Papa's heart stopped. But Johnny began breathing again, and Papa almost collapsed with relief. But there would come a day that Johnny did not start breathing again. And Papa did not know what would happen next.

He could not imagine a world without his son. His mind hit a wall every time he thought about it. He was physically unable to comprehend it. But soon, he would not only need to comprehend that world, but live in it. He would have to live in it every day for the rest of his life. 

"I did not consent to this," he whispered. Then, he screamed. "I DID NOT CONSENT TO THIS!!!"

The staff outside carried on, unfazed. They had probably seen random yelling like this before. They had probably seen it a lot.

Papa was yelling at random more and more these days. Maybe it was all the Valium he was taking. He did not recall if odd behavior was a side effect. All he really recalled was his personal doctor handing him a script for the largest amount he could legally dispense, with a note to call any time if Papa needed more. 

Papa was disappointed, after doing some research, to learn that taking the whole bottle would not kill him.

Johnny stirred in his bed again, breaking Papa's train of thought. But after a moment he lay still.

The pastor at church had called Papa into his private office shortly after Johnny's diagnosis. He went on and on about how God moves in mysterious ways, and we cannot understand His will, but we can take comfort in the thought that God wants the best for us. Papa stared at him and said, quietly, that if there was a God in heaven who could have stopped this, but didn't, that after Papa died, he would try to kill Him.

That was the end of that conversation.

Not long ago, Papa had tried to take Johnny to his favorite restaurant-- McDonald's of all places-- to have one last hamburger, one last milkshake. But Johnny couldn't keep his food down. He couldn't even hold a sip of water. But he smiled at Papa and squeezed his hand, saying it was alright, he was just happy to be out of the hospital with his dad.

Yes, God moves in mysterious ways. God moves in *very* mysterious ways. One must wonder if God moves at all.

Papa screamed and trashed his house when he made it home that afternoon. All he wanted was to have one last fry with his sweet little boy. He didn't want money, or fame, or health, or inner peace, or anything like that. All he wanted, *ALL* he wanted, was a healthy son.

And that's all he couldn't have.

The pastor was not the only one who had tried to comfort Papa, of course. His sister-in-law sat with him on the front stoop and told him, gently, to trust what the Universe has in store for him. He hit her. He had never hit a woman before. His brother came and tried to lay on some tough love-- everybody's gotta die someday, and some parents gotta lose their children, you gotta man up, Papa-- and he hit him too. 

Papa wondered if anyone in his family would talk to him after all this. Probably not. Not that he cared.

After the McDonald's episode, Johnny was too sick to go out. Papa tried to take him out, though. He went to the desk and asked for the paperwork for a TTV so he could take Johnny to the lake for a picnic and the nurse behind the desk said something about Johnny being medically unfit, doctor's orders, and after a couple of minutes of back-and-forth Papa screamed and jumped across the counter because he wanted to kill her, to kill this woman who was stopping him from having one last outing with his son.

Security escorted him out. Said they wouldn't press charges. They were understanding.

So Papa went alone. He drove to the lake all by himself, sobbing like a child. He had thought he was all cried out, that there was no way he could ever get those waterworks going again, not after all the crying that happened in the beginning, but he cried now. He cried and cried and cried. 

Papa rented a canoe and let himself drift on the lake. It was a beautiful day. The sun was out, the wind was gently caressing his face, and for one horrible moment, Papa forgot... Papa forgot that his son was sick. He recoiled in horror-- the guilt, the shame, *HOW COULD HE FORGET*-- and he realized a terrible truth-- the only way for him to be happy was to forget about his son. 

Papa wondered if he would ever actually be happy again.

He stayed in that boat for a long time. The brief moment of forgetfulness had been nice, but the return to reality... It was like the reverse feeling of waking up after a nightmare. His life *was* the nightmare, and there was no escaping it.

Papa's thoughts returned to the room. Johnny was sound asleep, breathing slowly, deeply. There seemed to be a slight smile on his face. They had him on some heavy pain meds, and it seemed that at least for now, he was at peace.

Papa thought that it would be alright if time just stopped now. If the rest of his eternity was spent sitting next to his sweet little boy, his sweet little boy who didn't deserve ANY of this, watching him drift lazily in the twilight of the narcotics in his veins. Perfectly peaceful. Perfectly safe. 

Papa laid his head gently on Johnny's chest. He relaxed as he felt the gentle rise... and fall... rise... and fall of Johnny's breathing. Papa did not cry. He was all cried out. He did not think he would ever cry again.

Then, Papa felt Johnny's hand reach for his. Johnny squeezed, and Papa's heart was filled with joy at that simple, beautiful sign of life. But Papa also felt fear. Fear that it would be the last time. 

But it was not the last. Not now. Not this time.

Papa let his head rest on Johnny's chest. He closed his eyes. He was going to forget about the world for a while. He was going to forget about sickness, and hospitals, and death. He was going to think only of his son, feel the warmth emenating from his body, the life in his movements, the smile on his face as the pain medicine massaged away any feelings of pain or anxiety. Yes, it would be alright if time just stopped right now. It would be perfectly, beautifully alright if time stopped now.

"That stupid 📖🚫 whore 💃 can't 🚫 tear us apart." 💖💕💓Something I'm very proud of is my IQ. It's incredibly high and it gives me power over all the plebious ignorants on this site. Only a select few in the world, and possibly the universe, could possibly hold a conversation with me without getting confused. This is because I discuss things like quantum physics, black holes and time and space themselves. My intellect is far superior to the common man. I could take all of you in a fight. I'm currently pursuing a doctorate in medicine, criminology and neuropsychology. Yes, I'm getting a triple doctorate. Jealous? I would assume so. Move along now, unless you have an IQ of over 190 I don't wish to communicate with you on any level. I could take any and all of you in a fight.Well, Mount Everest is approximately 29,000 feet tall. With 1,000 Anakins in play, Obi-Wan has 29 feet of high ground per Anakin.

In Episode III, we saw Obi-Wan defeat Anakin using the high ground. If Obi-Wan had less than  29 feet of high ground when he defeated Anakin then, we can safely conclude that he could beat 1,000 Anakins with a high-ground advantage of 29,000 feet.

Judging by footage from Episode III, Obi-Wan appears to be standing approximately two and a half of his own body lengths above the level of the lava. Since Ewan McGregor is 5 feet, 9.5 inches tall, he is approximately 14 feet, 5.75 inches above the level of the lava. Taking into account the fact that Anakin was actually jumping from a little bit above the level of the lava, the fact that Obi-Wan may have been able defeat Anakin from an even lower ground, and the fact that I purposely erred on the side of overestimating Obi-Wan’s elevation, it seems clear that a 29 foot advantage is more than twice what Obi-Wan needs to defeat a single Anakin.

Thus, I conclude that Obi-Wan would definitely be able to defeat 1,000 Anakins if he was standing atop Mount Everest. In fact, he would probably even defeat 2,000 Anakins. In conclusion, don’t try it.My name is Cummy and I am a fucking idiotIS THAT A FORTNITE WIN ON MY SNAPCHAT?

⚠❌🚨 WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!  🚨❌⚠The year is 2048 and the Food Network finally shuts its doors and sells the channel, this puts everyone working at the network at this time out of a job. As we follow the last remaining worker onto his deathbed, he is surrounded by his family and friends. He knows his hours are numbered but he has to eat at one more restaurant. 

He dusts off his red convertible and drives off far away, frosting his remaining hair as he drives. Once he arrives at the restaurant he orders the largest juiciest burger on the menu. Once he receives his sandwich he reflects for a minute, thinking back to the forty seasons of his show and how every single meal was a blessing. 

He bites down on his burger and his heart stops. 

After he awakens in a bright white location, squinting his eyes he sees him. God himself with the same frosted tips as the man does. When the man asks “Where am I” the lord replied swiftly.

#The buck💵 stops ✋🚫 here 👇


****

The mods for r/copypasta are going to start removing copypasta we deem as low effort. 

What is low effort you say? Copypasta that takes advantage of u/Cummybot2000, copypasta that is 6 words long, copypasta that "replaces every other word with anal" etc. 

You get the idea. 

We hate to do this but there's just been such a large amount of low effort copypasta lately and it's just-not-good.

That being said...


We encourage 😁 you to find🔬🔭 top quality copypasta 🍝🍝 anywhere you can! Online forums🗣👥, comment sections on Reddit 👀 or anywhere else!

Edit: Whoever is down voting every one of my comments, show yourself you fucken pussy. Don’t be a soiboi and speak up.Haha god it's just so obvious how much you hate yourself eh. You're probably 14/15 right? Think you understand the world around you. Think your opinions are the real truth. Your future is written in everything that you write. And you probably think you're so complicated and unique. I can read you like a children's 5 page book. You're a nothing. And I wish anything I could say would change that, but frankly you're just one of the students that needs to fill the ranks at Mcdonalds. It's a hard truth but you need to swallow it quickly. You are not a creator, you are a destroyer. Someone that puts down everyone around themselves until they form a hole where there's only room for you. You lonely, sad fucking pit of pathetic. You will never be anything in this life. You will get up every day wanting to change yourself and be better today. But you'll never escape who you are. A nobody. So enjoy your life, enjoy putting people down, enjoy never amounting to anything. At least I'm doing something with my life, no matter how small you think that is. If doing this kind of shit online is what gets you to sleep at night, then go ahead. But never forget that you will live this life alone, depressed, and believing you are something more than you are. But it's just the opposite. You're a zero.

It's me, Peter Parker.

Your friendly neighborhood... you know.

I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider.

Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me.

Now...

\- Wow, look, it's Spider-Man!

people really like me.

Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes.

\- Yeah... - That's OK.

The city is safe and sound.

Guess I've had something to do with that.

My uncle Ben would be proud.

I still go to school,

top of my class.

Now, the Hamiltonian shows us

that the energy levels are perturbed by the electric field.

From the form of this matrix,

we can see...?

Miss Stacey?

\- That only the m=0 quantum states are affected.

Correct! Good work, Miss Stacey.

Parker.

You got something to add?

No, sir.

And I'm in love

with the girl of my dreams.

Hi. Um, Miss Watson left a ticket for me?

Peter Parker.

Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you.

It's my girlfriend!

Harry!

I need to talk to you.

Explain things.

Tell it to my father.

Raise him from the dead.

I'm your friend, Harry.

I cared about your father.

MJ.

Peter.

Was I good?

\- Good?

You were great. You were...

\- You say great?

I love my flowers. They're beautiful.

And those are from Harry.

Was he here tonight?

\- Yeah, I ran into him outside.

What's with you guys anyway?

It's complicated.

Tell me again, was I really good?

I was so nervous.

My knees were shaking.

Your knees were fine.

\- The applause was not very loud.

Yes, it was.

It's the acoustics.

It's all about diffusion.

It keeps the sound waves from grouping.

You see, when the sound waves, they propagate, then it's like an...

\- You are such a nerd.

Did you see that one?

You know what?

I'd like to sing on stage for the rest of my life

with you in the first row.

I'll be there.

Tell me you love me.

I love you.

I love you so much.

I always have.

You can't hide here, Flint.

I'm just here to see my daughter.

You are an escaped convict.

The cops are looking for you.

You're not getting near her.

You're nothing but a common thief.

You maybe even killed a man.

It wasn't even like that.

Wasn't.

I had good reason for what I was doing.

And that's the truth.

You and the truth, sitting in prison, having three meals a day together.

I live in a prison. It's a great truth.

And that is the truth that you left behind.

Right there in that bedrooom.

I missed you.

I missed you too, Daddy.

I promise

I'll make you healthy again.

Whatever it takes.

I'll get the money.

\- You get out of here.

Now.

I'm not a bad person.

Just had bad luck.

Peter, what is it?

It's MJ...

I'm gonna ask her to marry me!

Oh, Peter! Oh!

The day that uncle Ben asked me to marry him,

he was so scared and excited.

And very young.

And I loved him so fiercely.

Then you said yes, right?

No. I wanted to say yes, but I said no.

I wasn't ready,

neither was he.

So we took our time.

Looked forward to it.

Didn't want to run into something with nothing to count on but love.

A man has to be understanding

and put his wife before himself.

Can you do that, Peter?

Yeah. I think I can.

Then you have my blessing.

I hope you've considered a proper proposal.

Your uncle had it all planned.

He took me to the beach one Sunday.

He was a knockout in his bathing suit.

And I, I didn't look too bad myself.

We were very good swimmers.

It was a beautiful day,

and he said: "Let's swim to the island."

And at the island,

we found a perfect spot by an old tree,

and we lay down and looked up at the sky.

And then he said, "Close your eyes, May."

And I did. And then he said, "Open them."

And I did.

And he was holding this ring.

Dazzling, in front of me.

I thought it was the sun.

We'd be married 50 years

come August... if...

So.

I hope you make it very special

for Mary Jane.

Do something she'll never forget.

Give her this.

Come on.

Take it.

Harry.

\- You knew this was coming, Pete.

Listen to me! I didn't kill your father!

He was trying to kill me. He killed himself.

Shut up!

I'm still here, Peter!

Hate those things.

Harry.

Harry.

Harry!

Oh my God.

Harry!

Come on!

God!

\- And clear!

No response.

\- Recharge. Let's go again.

Clear!

No response.

We charge it one more time. And clear!

Captain Stacey.

What's this?

\- Flint Marko, the guy we tied to the Ben Paker homicide.

What about him?

\- He just broke out of Rikers.

And?

\- He's on the run.

He's in the marshlands. I think we got him.

There he is!

"DANGER

PARTICLE PHYSICS TEST FACILITY

KEEP OUT"

Euton, take the west side. Tommy, take the east.

Where'd he go?

That's it. It's charged.

\- Right.

Donnie, we got a little fluctuation on 1.

There's a change in the silicon mass.

It's probably a bird. It'll fly away when we fire it up.

Initiating demoleculisation.

How is he?

\- He's gonna be OK.

But there's been some memory impairment.

Particularly his short-term memory.

Right now, he can't remember the accident

or anything that happened to him recently.

Is it permanent?

It could be.

Only time will tell.

He's awake if you want to see him.

Uh-- maybe I should wait.

Nah, it's fine. Just keep it brief. Allow him to rest.

Hey, buddy.

\- Hey.

Hit my head.

Yeah.

Doctor said I was in an accident. Hit and run.

I don't remember much of anything.

My father--

he died, right?

This is all so weird.

Hi. I got here as fast as I could.

I know that face.

How are you doing?

I don't know.

Last thing I remember, I was falling...

somewhere.

You're still fine.

We love you, Harry.

It feels like

somehow I've been gone for a really long time.

Now I'm back home.

It's good to have you back.

I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you guys to scoot, OK?

OK.

\- All right, thank you.

Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

Yeah, great.

I think he's gonna be fine.

Think so.

And you guys seem great.

\- Yeah.

You have lovely friends.

My best friends.

I'd give my life for them.

Yeah?

\- It's me.

\- Oh! Hey!

You know I can't open the door.

It's stuck again?

Come on and help me.

I'm coming.

The review.

\- Oh!

The hated it. They hated me.

Well, they can't hate you.

"The young Miss Watson is a pretty girl.

"Easy on the eyes, but not on the ears.

"Her small voice didn't carry past the first row."

That's ridiculous. I was right there.

You were in the first row.

Yeah, but that's...

Listen. You were great.

That's a critic.

This is something you're gonna have to get used to.

Believe me, I know.

Spider-Man gets attacked all the time.

\- This isn't about you.

It's about me.

It's about my career.

\- I know, and I'm just saying,

you can't let it bring you down.

You just gotta believe in yourself.

You pull yourself together,

and you get right back on the horse.

\- Don't give me the horse thing.

Try to understand how I feel.

It's just...

I look at these words,

and it's like my father wrote them.

All cars. All cars in the vicinity of 54th and 6th Ave, please report. Crane out of control. Approach with caution.

Go get 'em, tiger.

Sorry.

Oh my God.

Seven Atom to central. That crane .

It's bigger than we thought. We're gonna need a major mobilization right away.

Just gotta douse the accelerator! Now!

OK, Gwen.

I've got a secret. It's my call for ya.

What is that thing doing in my background?

Captain Stacey, the guys look out of shot of it.

They can't shut down the crane.

Get Edison on the phone.

Have them kill the power of the whole block.

Are you all right?

It's coming back!

Oh my God. It's Gwen!

What?

What's she doing up there?

I don't know. I just saw her last night. She said she had a modeling gig.

Who are you?

\- It's Brock, sir.

Eddie Brock, jr.

I work at the Daily Bugle.

And I'm dating your daughter.

You OK?

\- Yeah.

I'm fine.

Thank you.

Hey, Spidey, hold on. Bugle needs a photo.

Thank God you're OK.

\- Daddy!

Hey. I'm the new guy.

\- New guy?

From now on, I'm gonna be taking shots of you for the Bugle.

So-- smile! Are you smiling?

Where's the other guy?

\- Peter Parker?

Yeah, um, look, between you and me--

The guy's kind of an amateur.

Have you noticed, his stuff makes you look a little... bloated.

Just a little chunky.

\- OK...

Don't have to worry about that anymore, buddy.

Dazzeling.

Just a little something the boys in the ad department and I whipped up.

As you know, circulation of the Bugle has been pretty good.

Though not as good as the New York Times

or the Daily News

or the Post or several other smaller...

\- Get on with it, moron!

What?

\- Your blood pressure, Mr Jameson.

Your wife told me to tell you to watch the anger.

\- You tell my wife...

Thank you.

So, I propose this campaign:

"DAILY BUGLE" -- that's obvious.

"IT'S HIP, IT'S NOW" -- I came up with that one.

"IT'S WOW" -- that's actually Eric's.

"AND HOW!" -- that's me again.

Time to take your pill.

Not that one.

Not that one.

Drink plenty of water.

Thank you.

Continue.

He's busy.

Oh, no, I'm just here to talk to you, babe.

(- What's that smell?)

That's a little something called

"Nice 'n' Easy".

What's on you?

\- It's called "Go Away".

That is the dumbest idea you've ever had. You have had some daunting...

\- Blood pressure.

Hey, where are you going?

Who are you?

\- You hired him last week.

Freelance.

\- I did? What's that smell?

Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.

Wow, I really like that shirt.

Here. It's a crane accident. Check out the light source.

He likes my shirt.

Hey, Betty.

\- Hey, Pete. You better get in there.

A new guy. He's trying to sell some Spidey photos.

Uh. Thanks.

Parker! You're late! Maybe too late. Bruckner here beat ya to it.

It's Brock, sir. Edward Brock junior.

\- I got you this.

But he got me this.

Wait. How'd you get that? I didn't see you.

\- How'd you get that high?

Climbed. Nearly fell off a flagpole.

A flagpole?

Which one do we use?

\- I like Bernstein's.

It's better.

\- Cheaper, too.

Congratulations, son. We'll use your shot and pay you 50 bucks.

Uh-- all right, JJ. I'm your man.

I know more about what makes a good picture

than any photographer in this town.

See, photography, it's not just about

\-- no offense -- flagpoles. Whatever.

It's about lighting. Composition. Drama.

I want a staff job, sir.

I have a girl that I intend to marry, and--

I have this stupid little dream of-- working with one of the greatest newspaper editors of our time.

J. Jonah Jameson.

Well, we do have an opening.

Johnson quit, remember?

\- You fired him.

\- Whatever.

Wait a minute. I know what makes a good picture,

and I've been here for a long time. If there's a staff job,

Mr Jameson, I think I deserve it.

He's right, Jonah. Peter's been with us for years.

He's done a great job.

You want a staff job, and you want a staff job.

Anybody care about what I want?

I do.

\- Shut up. Get out.

I want the public to see Spider-Man for the two-bit criminal he really is.

He's a fake. He's full of stickum.

Catch him in the act.

"Spider-Man with his hand in the cookie jar".

Whoever brings me that photo gets the job.

What are you waiting for, Chinese New Year? Go, go, go!

I'm on it, boss.

You'll never get that shot.

We'll see.

You know,

I guess one person can make a difference.

'Nuff said.

Welcome home, Harry.

Thank God you're all right.

Thanks, Bernard.

Aperitif?

\- Sure.

Got you a little homecoming present.

Wha-- It's your old ball!

\- Yeah.

Thanks, buddy.

We were pretty good in the backyard, weren't we?

We were terrible. And we tried out for the varsity team.

Yeah, for the cheerleaders.

\- Right.

Hey, do I have any girlfriends?

I don't know.

\- You don't?

Hey Bernard, do I have any girlfriends?

\- Not that I know of, sir.

That's a pretty cool pass, huh?

It's OK.

Looks like I'm not worrying for money.

No.

Well, I bet I can turn this little girlfriend thing around.

You know,

he always appreciated how you helped me through high school.

I just wish I could remember more about him.

He loved you.

That's the main thing.

Hey, let's watch the game in the kitchen.

Get something to eat.

\- OK.

Whoa, catch that!

Did you see that?

Still got the moves.

Yeah!

Why are you stopping?

What is she doing here?

Gary, you were supposed to call her agent.

Hi, honey.

We tried to reach you.

I'm sorry.

One critic?

\- No, all the papers, dear.

Mary Jane, honey. Sit down. Let's explain it to you.

\- If you like, we could say you became ill.

That was so poorly handled.

\- Yeah. Let's just rehearse.

All right, Spidey!

Excuse me, miss. Let me see that gorgeous smile.

Hi, Eddie.

You're so beautiful.

This is front page stuff.

I've got to practice. I'll see you later, OK?

How about tonight?

\- Not tonight.

Why not?

Think of that amazing-- night that we had.

We had a coffee, Eddie.

Hey, beautiful.

One more.

Everything OK?

\- Yeah. I'm fine.

You're not still mad at me, are you?

No, Peter. I'm proud of you.

Hey. I'm gonna be swingin' it from over there.

So you know where to look.

Give 'em a good show.

Don't worry about that review.

We're gonna be laughing about it tomorrow night.

Promise.

\- Yeah.

Isn't that that guy from that prison break?

He fits.

Hey you! Halt!

Cover the back!

Fire!

People of the city of New York, I am here today

because I fell 62 storeys

and someone caught me.

Someone who never asks for anything in return.

Someone who doesn't even want us to know who he is.

Hey, MJ.

\- Harry.

Where is Pete?

Um-- taking somebody's picture, I guess.

I'm so happy to see you. You look so good.

I've never felt better.

It's a weird feeling, not knowing New York.

Bump on the head, I'm just free as a bird.

Will you bump me on the head?

\- Bop.

Hey, Pete said you're in a play.

You came. You sent me flowers.

I did?

I'll come again tonight.

You can't.

I--I was let go.

What happened.

I wasn't very good.

You know, this is embarrassing, but...

I once wrote you a play in high school.

You wrote me a play?

Yeah.

\- Harry, that's the sweetest thing.

I ask you: When you're dropping without a parachute

or your store's being robbed

or your house is on fire,

who is it that brakes your fall, puts out the flames and saves your children?

Spider-Man!

They love me!

Then let's hear it! For your one and only friendly neighborhood...

Spider-Man!

Kiss him!

Kiss him!

Go ahead, lay it right on me.

Really?

\- Yeah, they'll love it.

Kiss him! Kiss him!

\- No, Spider-Man, no!

Right...

Hope Pete's getting a shot of this.

Hey, are you OK?

\- Yes, I'm fine.

Jig's up, pal.

I don't want to hurt you.

Leave now.

\- I guess you haven't heard?

I'm the sheriff 'round these parts.

OK.

Where do all these guys come from?

Bonsoir. Le monsieur a-t-il un "reservation"?

I'm sorry, I don't speak...

\- But this is a French restaurant, non?

Oui.

Name, please?

\- Parker, Peter.

Ah. Here we are.

Table for two. Pekar.

Parker.

\- That is what I said.

Pekar.

Um, I have a request.

My girlfriend will be coming,

and I have this ring.

Ah. All.

Oh, so you want to pop the question tonight, hein?

Yes, and I want to do something very special.

I love it.

Romance.

I am French.

When I signal you, if you'd bring some champagne with the ring...

In ze bottom of her glass?

Perfect.

\- Magnifique.

Also I thought, at the same time

could the musicians

play this song?

Their favorite.

And take good care of the ring.

Ah oui, with my life, monsieur.

\- S'il vous plat.

\- Oui.

I like you.

Thank you.

"Bon" chance.

Bonne chance.

OK, so... How would you like some champagne?

How'd that get in there?

Aw, don't cry.

Look at you, wow! Beautiful.

\- Thanks.

Is this place in your budget?

Oh, it's a special occasion.

You're on Broadway.

I don't feel like much of a star tonight.

Well, you are a star.

And you've earned it.

Peter, you have no idea how I feel right now.

Oh no, I know exactly how you feel.

Listen.

I have been through this.

Happens to me all the time.

I see Spider-Man posters in the window.

Kids running around with me on their sweaters.

Big Hallowe'en item.

I don't know, I guess I've become something of an icon.

Like yesterday.

They keep screaming: "Spider-Man! Spider-Man!"

I don't know, I mean,

I'm thinking to myself,

"I'm just a nerdy kid from Queens. Do I deserve this?"

Hi, Pete.

\- Hi.

Hi. My parents and I are just having dinner here.

Hello.

I'm Gwen Stacey.

This is Mary Jane Watson.

Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you. Pete talks about you all the time.

Gwen is my lab partner in Dr Connor's class.

Pete's something of a genius. I'd be completely lost without him.

Which actually reminds me--

Pete, if you got a picture of my kiss with Spider-Man,

could you bring it to class?

I'd really love it.

For my portfolio.

After all, who gets kissed by Spider-Man, right?

I can't imagine.

Well, it was lovely to meet you.

Good night.

\- Good night.

Uh, she's in my science class. It's not her best subject.

What?

How come you never mentioned her?

She's your lab partner,

you saved her life,

she thinks you're a genius and she had her polished fingernails all over you?

Or didn't you notice?

And she gave Spider-Man the key to the city.

I'll never forget that.

She's just a girl in my class.

\- Let me ask you something.

When you kissed her,

who was kissing her?

Spider-Man or Peter?

What do you mean?

\- You know exactly what I mean.

That was our kiss.

Why would you do that?

You must have known how it made me feel.

Do you want to push me away?

Push you away?

Why would I want to push you away? I love you.

You're my girlfriend. She's a girl in my class, MJ.

I don't feel very well. I'm sorry. I have to go.

Where are you going?

\- Please don't follow me.

Here we are.

Hi, it's MJ. Sing a song at the beep. Beep!

Hello. Uh...

I wish you'd pick up the phone.

I don't know what's going on.

I don't know if you got the messages, or what.

But...

I just want to talk to you.

OK. Call me, all right?

Hallo?

\- Mr Parker?

Yeah?

\- This is Detective Neil Garettfrom the 2nd precinct.

I'm calling on behalf of Captain Stacey.

He would like you to come down to the station to speak with him.

Originally we thought that this man, Dennis Carradine,

was your husband's killer.

We were wrong.

What?

\- Turns out Mr Carradine was only an accomplice.

The actual killer is still at large.

What are you talking about?

This is the man who killed your husband.

His name is Flint Marko.

He's a small-time crook who's been in and out of prison.

You got this wrong.

Two days ago, he escaped.

Evidently, he confessed his guilt to a cellmate.

And we have a couple of witnesses who corroborate the story.

No, wait, sir. You don't want to do this.

Get in! What are you doing?

Would you put these photos away, please?

I'm sorry, Mrs Parker. I know this isn't easy,

but please be patient with us.

We're doing our job. We will catch him.

No, you're not doing your job.

I watched my uncle die.

We chased down the wrong man.

Now you're telling me there's suspicions for two years? Witnesses?

Why weren't we told about this?

\- Settle down, sir.

No, I have no intention of settling down!

This man killed my uncle,

and he's still out there!

L-20 Parkway, all officers in the vicinity please report.

We have an abandoned vehicle and an abandoned man in the middle of the street.

Sorry, Wabash Avenue.

Peter, it's MJ.

I'm not here about what happened at dinner. Just please open up.

Aunt May called me. She told me about what happened.

She's worried about you.

I'm worried about you.

Don't be. I'm fine.

I don't want you to do something stupid.

Like try to find my uncle's killer?

And do something you'll regret.

Like...

with that other guy.

He had a gun on me.

I made a move, and he fell. I told you that.

\- I'm not accusing you of anything.

C-22, auto at 566, 9th Avenue...

\- Will you turn that thing off?

Peter, I'm here because I care about you.

And I know that you made a mistake and that you feel guilty, but--

I want to be here for you.

\- OK.

I get it. Thank you.

But, uh, I'm fine.

I don't need your help.

Everybody needs help sometimes, Peter.

Even Spider-Man.

90 - X-ray - 98.

10-31 at 642, Madison Av...

1-3-Tom has responded 10-20 at 540, East 107...

male inside apartment B on first floor...

310-11 of a residence, 738...

Don't hurt me! Just give me a chance!

\- What about my uncle?

Did you give him a chance?

Did you?

Where am I?

What is this?

I feel...

Wow.

This feels good.

This is something else.

What do you think?

I've never seen anything like it.

I'm a physicist, not a biologist, but...

I'll look at it in the morning, run some tests.

\- Can we do that now?

It seems to like you.

Don't let any of that get on you.

\- Why not?

It has the characteristics of a symbiote,

which needs to bond to a host to survive.

And sometimes, these things in nature, when they bind,

they can be hard to unbind.

Bank robbery in progress, First Eastern Bank Bismarck.

Another sand storm is reported in the vicinity. All cars, proceed with caution.

Marko.

Buddy, love the new outfit.

This is exactly what I need to scoop, partner. Give me some of that web action.

See you, chum.

What the hell?

Flint Marko?

What do you want from me?

Remember Ben Parker?

The old man you shot down in cold blood?

What does it matter to you anyway?

Everything!

It's time to pay, Marko.

Good riddance.

Re-ent!

Not now.

This is a free country. It's not a rent-free country.

Leave me alone.

Give me rent.

You'll get your rent when you fix this damn door!

That wasn't cool.

He is good boy.

He must be in some kind of trouble.

Flint Marko, the man who killed uncle Ben--

he was killed last night.

O my--

What happened?

Spider-Man killed him.

Spider-Man?

I don't understand.

Spider-Man doesn't kill people.

What happened?

I... He was...

I thought that you'd feel...

He deserved it, didn't he?

I don't think it's for us to say whether a person deserves to live or die.

Aunt May, he killed uncle Ben.

Uncle Ben meant the world to us.

But he wouldn't want us living one second with revenge in our hearts.

It's like a poison.

It can take you over.

Before you know it,

turn us into something ugly.

Hello.

Hey, Harry, it's MJ.

Hi.

\- I need some company.

Are you doing anything? Can I stop by?

Yeah, sure. Come on over.

OK. Are you sure it's OK?

I'm not doing anything.

Please, come over.

OK, I'll see you soon.

Great.

\- Bye.

Bernard?

\- Yes, Mr Osborn?

We're having a guest. Can you get some food?

A guest?

\- Yeah, a guest.

A guest guest?

Will you just get some food?

Rightaway, sir.

Hey, Mr Ditkovitch.

An orange?

No, thanks.

Listen--

I'm really sorry for what happened earlier.

I shouldn't have yelled about that door. It was nothing to be angry about.

Ah, it's not big deal.

But if you feel that bad about it,

you can buy me pizza some time.

Today's good.

OK.

Have problem with the phone?

No, no, I was just-- was trying to figure out what to say.

If it's a woman you're calling,

then you say: "You're a good woman,

"I'm good man."

Hi, Pete.

\- Hi.

He's calling a woman.

\- Are you calling Mary Jane?

I think that would be so good...

\- It's none of your business.

Go! Go.

Give her a call.

\- Thanks.

Bye.

\- Bye.

You hungry?

Yeah.

Come in.

Hope you like peppers.

I love 'em.

Oh, the butter!

Well, we can use that part.

"You've been dreaming."

"Nothing like a little self-deception to get you through the night."

All right.

\- When did you write that?

\- It's intense.

So, do you want the part?

I'd love to be in your play.

\- Cheers.

You know, there's not even a scar.

Barely.

Sorry.

\- Me too.

I didn't mean to do that.

\- No, it's OK. Please.

Forgive me.

Mary Jane.

Mary Jane.

Mary Jane, please!

\- I'm sorry.

You've taken your eye off the ball.

What have you done?

Avenge me!

My father-- he died, right?

Yeah.

Just wish that I could remember more about him.

Well, he loved you.

That's the main thing.

I swear on my father's grave: Spider-Man will pay.

Harry.

Remember me?

Yes, father.

I remember.

I was right about her,

about Peter,

about everything.

You know what you must do.

Make him suffer. Make him wish he were dead.

First we attack his heart.

Hi, it's me. Sing your song at the beep.

Hey, MJ.

It's Peter.

I want to talk to you about last night.

I don't know what I was thinking.

I know you were just there to help, and--

I, uh-- I don't know, I want to see you.

If you want Peter to live,

you're gonna do something for me.

Yeah?

\- It's Ursula.

Come in.

Hi, Pete.

\- Hi.

There's a phone call for you.

It's Mary Jane, she called back!

Really?

\- Yeah!

I put the phone on top of the thing.

Thanks. OK.

Hey.

\- Hi.

I was so glad you called.

I've been-- trying to--

\- Can you meet me?

You bet.

\- Now?

OK. Where?

At the bridge, in the park.

On my way.

Hey. I love you.

You look beautiful.

Peonies.

You OK?

No.

There's something I have to tell you, Pete.

\- OK.

It's not working.

You and me.

What?

I don't want to see you anymore.

What are you talking about?

I don't know.

I'm lonely.

You aren't there for me.

I can't do this.

It's over.

\- No. Please.

Please don't say that.

I know, I've been selfish.

But I can do better. I can change.

\- It's not that simple.

We love each other! I love you!

And we have problems. When people have problems, they work it out.

They talk to each other.

Look, you see?

You know what this is?

You know what I want for us?

\- There's someone else.

I've fallen in love with someone else.

She says that she's lonely,

and that I'm not there for her.

There's another guy.

How are you holding up?

Not good.

Harry, I was going to propose to her.

Really?

She's been going through a tough time lately.

Career.

I mean, a singing waitress at a jazz club--

that's not exactly what she had in mind for herself.

A singing waitress? What are you talking about?

She was fired from the show.

Didn't she tell you?

She was fired?

She was fired and she told you?

She didn't tell me?

That's why I asked you here, Pete.

I'm the other guy.

What?

Look, she came to me one afternoon, troubled.

She needed someone, and I was there for her.

I've always loved her, Pete.

You know that.

It just...

started.

I don't believe this.

I don't believe you.

I'm really sorry.

I just thought you should know.

Can I warm you up?

Yes, please.

How's the pie?

So good.

Would you like a drink?

I'm sorry.

What was I thinking? Bad for the public image, right, Mr Key-to-the-city?

What did you do to her?

I did what you failed to do.

I was there for her.

Mary Jane and I, we understand each other.

She doesn't know what you are.

Peter. She knows me very well.

And when she kissed me,

it was just like she used to kiss me.

That taste.

Strawberries.

How d'ya like that, Spidey?

That all you got?

Stinks, doesn't it?

I protected you in high school. Now I'm gonna kick your little ass.

You gonna kill me like you killed my father?

I'm done trying to convince you.

You took him from me.

He loved me.

No:

he despised you.

You were an embarrassment for him.

Look at that little Goblin junior.

Gonna cry?

"THIEF! Spider-Man shows his true colors"

\- Spider-Man used to make me feel safe.

Now I'm afraid to walk home from work.

My son thought the world of this guy.

I have a 9 year old daughter, loves Spider-Man.

Who's she supposed to look up to now?

This is the guy they gave the key to the city to?

I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye.

Cheers! New staff photographer!

\- I just got lucky.

This is so wonderful for you.

Well, you might wanna tell JJ to make a little more wall space.

Good morning.

\- It's a beautiful day, huh?

What was it you said, I'll never get that picture?

There's your hero.

I never thought he'd really do that.

See? Right there,

you made a judgment call.

You gotta see it as it is.

It's funny you should say that,

'cause I was looking through some old photos, and

looks very, uh-- similar.

OK-- Well, I gotta get back to work.

You're trash, Brock.

Excuse me?

Your picture is a fake.

Parker, you are such a boy scout.

When are you gonna give a guy a break?

You want forgiveness?

Get religion.

What's going on here?

\- Are you guys all right?

Yeah, no, we're just horsin' around.

Look, I'm begging you. If you do this,

I will lose everything.

There's not a paper in town that will hire me.

You should've thought of that earlier.

What are you doing, Peter?

Show this to the editor. Tell him to check his source next time.

It's a fake!

Empire State Photographic Department confirms it.

Pack your things. Get out of my building.

I was just...

\- You're fired!

You know we're gonna have to print a retraction now.

Haven't printed a retraction in 20 years!

"SORRY SPIDEY

Bugle drops charges"

Shalom?

\- Mr Parker?

Dr Connors here.

\- Oh, Dr Connors!

How are you?

Quite a specimen you left me, Parker.

Its chemistry is not unlike the meteorites of the 70s.

Thanks. It's good.

You know what, Parker?

Parker?

Give me some milk.

It amplifies characteristics of its host.

Hey, give me another cookie.

Specially aggression.

This can be dangerous.

Peter, you didn't keep any, did you?

You got any with nuts?

Um-- I have some nuts, I could make some.

Go make me some.

Peter?

\- No, no. Of course not.

Your shots are so good.

I'd love to shoot you sometime.

Peter Parker! Peter...

Parker!

Miss Brent, that's not the position I hired you for!

Black suit Spider-Man!

Peter, these are incredible!

We gotta have these, Jonah.

I'll pay you the usual rate.

If you want the shots, I'll take the staff job. Double the money.

You are really gonna dig this joint.

Do you think I'm dressed all right?

Too fancy or...

You're looking fine, babe.

Thank you.

Love that little giggle.

Oh, this is so cool!

I have never been to a jazz club before.

I hope we can get a table.

Find us some shade.

Thanks, .

Right this way, sir.

"RESERVED"

Thank you.

I'm so loving this.

\- Oh, me too.

Isn't that your old girlfriend?

Yeah.

Do you want to go someplace else?

No, no. I'll be OK.

Mary Jane, show us what you got.

I'll be right back.

\- Right.

Peter?

This is for you.

Double time!

Thanks.

Now dig all this.

That was all for her?

I'm so sorry.

You all right, Mary Jane?

I'm fine.

\- OK.

Hey.

What's wrong with you?

You.

Can I help you, sir?

No.

\- Is everything OK here, Paul?

Yeah, is everything OK here, Paul?

Take him out of here.

\- Let's go, sir.

Take your hand offa me. Now.

Peter, stop!

Who are you?

I don't know.

It's Brock, Sir.

Edward Brock junior.

I come before you today

humbled

and humiliated

to ask you for one thing.

I want you to kill Peter Parker.

Parker?

Hi, Peter.

\- Hi.

You don't seem to have changed the room around very much.

Of course, there's not much you can do,

is there?

When we spoke on the phone,

I sensed something was bothering you,

so I thought I'd just come by.

How's Mary Jane?

I don't know.

I never heard from you.

Did you ever propose?

You said

a husband's gotta put a wife before himself.

I'm not ready.

But what happened?

You seemed so sure.

Yeah. I...

I heard her, aunt May.

I don't know what to do.

You start by doing the hardest thing.

You forgive yourself.

I believe in you, Peter.

You're a good person.

And I know you will find a way to put it right.

In time.

I don't like Spider-Man.

I want him dead too, Flint.

That's why I've been looking for you.

Oh yeah. I know all about you.

Like the fact that Spider-Man

won't let you help your poor daughter.

It's just-- It doesn't seem right to me.

Look.

I wanna kill the Spider.

You wanna kill the Spider.

Together, he doesn't stand a chance.

Interested?

Yeah.

So--

where to?

"BREAKING NEWS: City in crisis"

\- All New York is holding its breath

as a hostage crisis continues to unfold.

Just thirty minutes ago, police came across this startling sight:

A young woman held hostage in a taxi

suspended 80 storeys above the ground

in what appears to be a giant web.

Every attempt by the police to rescue the hostage

has been flaunted by the Sandman.

Compounding the danger is the appearance of a strange black-suited figure.

Early reports had believed him

to be the black-suited Spider-Man. But he is now been identified

as something entirely different.

The hostage has been identified

as Mary Jane Watson,

an actrice recently seen in a brief stint on Broadway.

We're now going to take you live to the scene with Jennifer Dugan.

Jennifer?

\- We're only about 100 feet away now, Hal, and--

Wait. There seems to be some kind of activity in the web.

It seems to be creating some kind of gigantic lettering.

"SPIDER-MAN, STOP US IF YOU CAN"

Apparently, Spider-Man is being challenged to some sort of confrontation.

And that raises serious questions about what kind of chance he'd stand

against such overwhelming...

Harry.

I need your help.

Can't take them both. Not by myself.

You don't deserve my help.

Harry,

she needs us.

Get out.

If I may, Sir.

I've seen things in this house

I've never spoken of.

What are you trying to tell me?

The night your father died

I cleaned his wound.

The blade that pierced his body

came from his glider.

I know

you're trying to defend your father's honor,

but there's no question

that he died by his own hand.

I loved your father.

As I have loved you, Harry.

As your friends love you.

Look!

He seems to have come out of nowhere to answer the prayers of the city,

just when all hope seemed to be lost.

Peter?

They're gonna kill us both.

I'm gonna get you out of this.

Watch out!

Hey, Parker.

My God. Eddie?

Oh, my spider-sense is tickling.

If you know what I'm talking about.

We can find a way to settle this.

You're so right.

I'm thinking-- humiliation.

Kinda like you humiliated me.

Do you remember?

Do you remember what you did to me?

You made me lose my girl.

Now I'm gonna make you lose yours.

How's that sound, tiger?

Hold on, Mary Jane!

Mary Jane.

It's hard to believe what's happening.

The brutality of it.

I don't know how he can take any more.

This can be a tragic day

for the people of New York.

It could be the end of Spider-Man.

Awesome!

\- Wicked cool!

You came.

Looks like just in the nick of time.

A couple of minutes ago wouldn't have been so bad either.

What're you gonna do.

I'm needing some help over here.

I'm a little busy right now.

Give me your hand!

Parker!

Parker, where...

I need a photographer!

Hey, kid. You want a job?

Why would I want a job?

I'm just a kid.

All right, how much for the camera?

One hundred bucks.

\- A hundred bucks?

All right, you little prick. Here.

Film's extra.

Gotcha.

Pete, watch out!

You still got any more?

\- Hang on!

To what?

Go, buddy!

\- Got her!

You OK?

Yeah.

Good.

Hey, Pete.

Am I interrupting?

Never wound

what you can't kill.

Eddie-- this suit-- you gotta take it off!

Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

I know what it feels like.

It feels good.

The power. Everything.

But you'll lose yourself.

Let it go.

I like being bad.

It makes me happy.

Harry!

Peter, what are you doing?

No!

Eddie!

Harry?

\- Mary Jane.

I'm going to get help.

Stay.

I didn't want this.

But I had no choice.

We always have a choice.

You had a choice when you killed my uncle.

My daughter was dying.

I needed money.

I was scared.

I told your uncle all I wanted was the car.

What is it?

\- I need your car.

He said to me:

"Why don't you just put down the gun and go home?"

I realize now he was just trying to help me.

Then I saw my partner running over with the cash,

and the gun was in my hand.

Did a terrible thing to you.

I spent a lot of nights wishing I could take it back.

I'm not asking you to forgive me.

I just want you to understand.

I've done terrible things too.

You didn't choose to be this.

The only thing left to me now

is my daughter.

I forgive you.

Hey, pal. How are you doing?

Been better.

We'll get you through this.

No.

You should never forgive...

...said those things.

None of that matters, Peter.

You're my friend.

Best friend.

Whatever comes our way.

Whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice.

My friend Harry taught me that.

He chose to be the best of himself.

It's the choices that make us who we are,

and we can always choose to do what's right.

I'm through with love

I'll never fall again

Said adieu to love

Don't ever call again

For I must have you

Or no one

And so I'm through with love

I've locked my heart

I'll keep my feelings there

I have stocked my heart

With icy frigid air

And I mean to care

I’m going to 😵 a better ✨ place~*holds up gun*They just HAD to do it, didn't they? I'm GENUINELY at a loss right now. It's the only place where I felt at home, where I get to enjoy the company of people like ME, where I get to sympathize with individuals who's in the same predicament as I am. Again and again we are set aside by the majority, by the 'normal', by the 'standard'. Why do most of you feel the need to crush us. We are already broken as it is, and you still desire to crush us further by banning our sub? You are probably thinking right now, 'who cares about how this misogynistic sociopath feels, better root them out now before they turn into rapists and murdurers.' You misunderstand, Outside we don't act like how we post in r/incels. It is our only means of releasing this pent up and clovered mess of emotions inside us. But now, our mouths are shut. What am I supposed to do with these emotions now? 'Seek mental health, go to X, go to Y.' Tell you what, time and time again, everything I've said falls into deaf ears, I've been into one for 5 years now and it does jack shit. 'mhmmm such a shame, take these medications' 'mhmmm have you tried sharing your shit hobbies to others? now come back next week'. FUCKING nignogs. They're only sucking my finances dry for fuck's sake, they're only there because it's their job, because it gets them money. r/incels on the other hand truly understood my problem because they have my problem. I am GENUINELY and UNIRONICALLY shedding a tear right now. Hentai is an even worse form of porn because it is even more unreal, even further removed from reality, even more capable of displaying utterly fucked up and extreme stuff that cannot exist in reality. You know the stuff Im talking about and I dont care if you say you only watch the 'good' kind of hentai. It is poison in the worst form. It is attractive, that is the problem. Down that road lies lonliness and dissatisfaction. You need to let that poison go and find incomparable joys in real life. Luckily they are common. Go feel the sun on your face. Run and feel your body move. You can do it.

Look, I'm not a hateful person or anything–I believe we should all live and let live. But lately, I've been having a real problem with these homosexuals. You see, just about wherever I go these days, one of them approaches me and starts sucking my cock.
Take last Sunday, for instance, when I casually struck up a conversation with this guy in the health-club locker room. Nothing fruity, just a couple of fellas talking about their workout routines while enjoying a nice hot shower. The guy looked like a real man's man, too–big biceps, meaty thighs, thick neck. He didn't seem the least bit gay. At least not until he started sucking my cock, that is.
Where does this queer get the nerve to suck my cock? Did I look gay to him? Was I wearing a pink feather boa without realizing it? I don't recall the phrase, "Suck my cock" entering the conversation, and I don't have a sign around my neck that reads, "Please, You Homosexuals, Suck My Cock."
I've got nothing against homosexuals. Let them be free to do their gay thing in peace, I say. But when they start sucking my cock, then I've got a real problem.
Then there was the time I was hiking through the woods and came across a rugged-looking, blond-haired man in his early 30s. He seemed straight enough to me while we were bathing in that mountain stream, but, before you know it, he's sucking my cock.
What is it with these homos? Can't they control their sexual urges? Aren't there enough gay cocks out there for them to suck on without them having to target normal people like me?
Believe me, I have no interest in getting my cock sucked by some queer. But try telling that to the guy at the beach club. Or the one at the video store. Or the one who catered my wedding. Or any of the countless other homos who've come on to me recently. All of them sucked my cock, and there was nothing I could do to stop them.
I tell you, when a homosexual is sucking your cock, a lot of strange thoughts go through your head: How the hell did this happen? Where did this fairy ever get the idea that I was gay? And where did he get those fantastic boots?
It screws with your head at other times, too. Every time a man passes me on the street, I'm afraid he's going to grab me and drag me off to some bathroom to suck my cock. I've even started to visualize these repulsive cock-sucking episodes during the healthy, heterosexual marital relations I enjoy with my wife–even some that haven't actually happened, like the sweaty, post-game locker-room tryst with Vancouver Canucks forward Mark Messier that I can't seem to stop thinking about.
Things could be worse, I suppose. It could be women trying to suck my cock, which would be adultery and would make me feel tremendously guilty. As it is, I'm just angry and sickened. But believe me, that's enough. I don't know what makes these homosexuals mistake me for a guy who wants his cock sucked, and, frankly, I don't want to know. I just wish there were some way to get them to stop.
I've tried all sorts of things to get them to stop, but it has all been to no avail. A few months back, I started wearing an intimidating-looking black leather thong with menacing metal studs in the hopes that it would frighten those faggots off, but it didn't work. In fact, it only seemed to encourage them. Then, I really started getting rough, slapping them around whenever they were sucking my cock, but that failed, too. Even pulling out of their mouths just before ejaculation and shooting sperm all over their face, neck, chest and hair seemed to have no effect. What do I have to do to get the message across to these swishes?
I swear, if these homosexuals don't take a hint and quit sucking my cock all the time, I'm going to have to resort to drastic measures–like maybe pinning them down to the cement floor of the loading dock with my powerful forearms and working my cock all the way up their butt so they understand loud and clear just how much I disapprove of their unwelcome advances. I mean, you can't get much more direct than that.Now before any of you report me for shitposting hear me out. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.I just saw The Incredibles 2. It was pretty enjoyable, a freshing and familiar throwback to days gone by.

I don't think it should be marketed as a children's movie however, as there are a few scenes that make me think that the PG rating wasn't quite right, such as the scene where Mr Incredible calls a coloured gentleman the N-word, and then then went on a 15 minute, explosive and explicit rant on how black people contribute the most to gun violence statistics in the United States. Yeah, not sure what the director was thinking.

Another odd scene was in the final battle between the Incredible family and the Underminer. The Underminer knocks over an embassy of a middle eastern country, and turns to screen and roars 'SYRIA IS ISREAL' , which was a little off, but only made stranger by the fact that he repeated it for 13 and a half minutes. Guess they just ran out of lines idk.

Speaking of running out of lines, the scene where Mr Incredible lynches Frozone didn't need to last 20 minutes. It was pretty graphic as well.

Overall, it was enjoyable, 7/10Alright, so here's what up. There was a period of time where iCarly.com was like a real website right, with legit video uploads. Well I was looking for this one porn of this bitch that looked like iCarly (I didn't know the actresses name) so I search on PornHub for iCarly, right, motherfucker they had like full episodes of the show on there. I'm like, yo, dope, I'll wait on the wank and watch this shit. Then I get all nostalgic and visit the website and yo, it's still up. So I watch a couple vids right? And I realize damn Jeannette McCurdy was fine! So I see what she looks like now and she still fine, like, damn. She looks better than iCarly. So I keep looking at pics of her and she reminds me of this chick I went to high school with, right? And so I shoot her a message just to see what she's up to. She in college. I'm like dope, glad to hear she's doing well. I shoot her a, "yo, you know I always thought you were pretty cute!" she goes "yo, same!" I'm like DOPE! We meet up for coffee one day and catch up, have a good time and it's awesome, right? So I go home keep kindling that flame, having a good week and I remember, yo, that iCarly bitch still fine too though! I shoot the girl I'd been talking to a message an hour or so later like, yo, what's that bitch's name who was on iCarly? She goes "Miranda Cauliflower?" I'm like, YOOOOO! So I log back on to PornHub and find the video I was looking for and I beat my fucking meat until even my hormones were like, "yo, that's a little much!" Anyways, that girl and I still talking but she live awhile away and it's hard cuz we both got shit. Anyone got any advice?Uitttutipparr

 Attention all Fortnite gamers: John Wick is in great danger and he needs your help to wipe out the squads in the Tilted Towers, but to do this he needs a golden scar and a couple of chug jugs. To help him, all he needs is your credit card number, the three digits on the back, and the expiration month and year. But, you gotta be quick, so John Wick can secure the bag and achieve the epic Victory Royal! You know what? I'll have you know that when I'm at max strength, I can break a bone in your body with ONE PUNCH. Seriously, ask my brother.FUCK YOU. I have heard that "lol you must be fun at parties" at least a hundred times. GET FUCKING ORIGINAL. Jesus fucking christ. Stop saying the same fucking thing over and over and over again. Just because you don't agree with me DOES NOT HAVE SHIT TO DO WITH PARTIES. What the fuck. Do you fucking fart at parties or something? If so I don't want to go to your shitty-ass parties in the first place. I'll stick to my wine and cheese dinners, you know, REAL FUCKING PARTIES. I downvoted you because not one thing you said was original. You're just a robot programmed to say these phrases over and over again to feel connected to 1s and 0s on the internet. You've never been to a party. That's why you say those things. WELL I'M FUCKING tired. of it. I'm tired. Say that to me one more fucking time and I will find you. I'm taking a stand. I am so sick of the stupid "parties" comeback. It's not fun. It's not clever. It's really fucking hurtful. Thanks a lot, dick. So what if you don't like what I said. Is that any reason to dismiss my entire comment and quote a little comeback. What's next, you're going to explain to me with crayons or call out my bullshit by how I overcomplicating things? If I see one more fucking party comment, I'm going to lose it. I'm going off the fucking chain and fucking report all you motherfuckers who think it's funny to comment about being fun at parties. Try me. I will do it. I will go STRAIGHT TO THE FUCKING TOP and then I'll be the one laughing while you beg for my mercy. Then you know what I'll say while you come to me crying and begging to die so you can stop the agony? I'll say "You must be fun at parties." So yeah, If you must know, I am pretty fun at parties. Not that you'll ever find out, dick.👆😎😎😎👉👉👉👉👉

👈👈👈👈👈😎😎😎👇 i got this new anime plot. basically there's this high school girl except she's got huge boobs. i mean some serious honkers. a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos. big ol' tonhongerekoogers. what happens next?! transfer student shows up with even bigger bonkhonagahoogs. humongous hungolomghononoloughongous and they fuckin battle it out because they all have a crush on the main guy and in later episodes it is revealed that they are actually robots that were exiled by their master and they think that if senpai loves them they will become human but that can be only accomplished by the witch with huge bonkhonagahoogs and the transfer girl and the other girl with a real set of badonkers. packin some dobonhonkeros. massive dohoonkabhankoloos big ol' tonhongerekoogers battle the witch and they barely manage to beat the witch and they are all naked for some reason with the main guy  bleeding a shit load of blood from his nose and the girls become human and senpai fucks them one by one (even the witch that is 200000 years old) and then the main guy goes around the world to add girls to his harem Uhm😤 by the way👩MOM 🙆They're not 🇨🇳 Chinese cartoons 📺💻it's called 😡ANIME!!!😍😍 GOT IT?!?! 😤😠
And they're ❌✋🙅NOT CHINESE!!! 🇨🇳 They're JAPANESE!!!!!!🇯🇵 🎌 So you'd better apologize 😱🙏🙇👎to me and my Waifu 👫💏RIGHT NOW 😡😠All right, so if instead of an "additionally calculated" Destroy Dick December (which means 1 nuts + 2 nuts + 3 nuts, etc.), we did a "factorially calculated" one (that I will officially refer to as Mutilate Member Month), it would be "1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! + 7! + 8! + 9! + 10! + 11! + 12! + 13! + 14! + 15! + 16! + 17! + 18! + 19! + 20! + 21! + 22! + 23! + 24! + 25! + 26! + 27! + 28! + 29! + 30! + 31!".

This means that the total amount of nutting you would need to do during the Mutilate Member Month is 8,497,249,472,648,064,951,935,266,660,940,313 nuts.

31 days equals to 2,678,400,000 milliseconds, so you would need to bust 3,172,509,510,397,276,341,074,995 fat nuts every millisecond to properly complete the challenge in time.You subhuman baboon.

How dare you speak, you swarthy jungle monkey. How dare you open your big lipped, rim encrusted, menthol cigarette smelling mouth?

You are human trash, Diego Tyrone LeShawn de Maradona. Universally despised, derided and mocked. Your nationality and skin tone offers no hope to the world that South America can ever prosper. Crawl back in to the Brazilian jungle you came out of, you literal orangutan.

I hope you decide to sail your grandfathers skip to the Falklands and rape some sheep, as is in the negroes nature. It would still be the whitest pussy you ever had. Give Nigel and Robert a chance for some target practice, your sole use to the world. Argentinians obsession with a few windswept islands in the Atlantic is hilarious but sad. Coincidentally its the only worthwhile contribution Argentina has made to the medical field. The MUH LAS MALVINAS sentiment in the average negro Argentinian is both an early warning sign of autism in children, and early on set Alzheimer's in adults.

Take your black hairy fingers off your keyboard, and never talk about the human species again, you mockery of our supposed shared ancestor.. No amount of olive oil and wheat flour slabbed on your face every morning will make you white. It's about as delusional of an idea as your daydreams of European heritage.

You nigger.

You make Bolivia look like a beacon of civilisation.

You are the Baltimore of South America.

Go fertilise the pampas with you and your families corpses, its the best you can hope for in life. For the first time in your life, nigger, you have a job making food for beings vastly superior to yourself. Uruguayan cattle. Coincidentally, it would be the first time an Argentinian "man" provided for a family.

Die, Diego. No one would miss you. Except for Australian Aboriginals, who now would have no one to make them look good.Gucci Walk, Yes, Carl Pump Yes, Gucci Walk, right

The fact that we've reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal. I'm, I'm just amazed. Thank you all so much for supporting this channel and helping it grow, I, I love you guys, you guys are just awesome*"Actually, I thought his comment was sarcastic, which is why I said what I said. My bad, I was wrong.*

*Serious question, not as an insult: are you struggling with some rough shit in your life? life-threatening job, terrible home drama, etc? Because you're lashing out like crazy man. I've been consistently admitting that I was wrong and you've gone and exploded and insisted that I was a narcissistic douche, and even gone off at other people in the thread who weren't even talking to you.*

*I legit thought that when I said "Like I said, I'm tired, I don't think rationally when I'm tired.", that would end the discussion. I figured you'd call me a fucking idiot like I expected and it would be over. Instead, I get accused of overreacting, when in actuality I was pretty calm so far in the thread.*

*I've noticed some of your other comments in other threads before. You seem like a real smart, cool-headed guy. So, I don't understand where all this pure rage is coming from. I keep looking back at my comments, trying to see where I said something hostile, something to justify your anger. I can't find anything. You seriously ought to calm down, take a breather, and go enjoy something - a walk, a movie, a video game, whatever your hobbies are, I don't know you - and then come back and think about all of this. In the end, all I did was make a stupid comment, and all but apologized for being stupid, and you came at me like I just kicked your dog.*

AAAAMy gender is a randomized 4-digit number. I’m also genderfluid so this number may change at any time. It is not my responsibility to tell you what my gender is, you should be able to tell by the way I am presenting. I may not always present as my gender, and if you expect me to then you’re just being cisnumeronormative. If you ever misgender me by getting any of my numbers wrong at any time, I WILL NOT hesitate to call you a transdigitphobe. Sometimes my gender is the product  of a mathematical algorithm. You think you can get away with not performing a wide range of complex calculations to accurately determine my gender value at any given time? If I see you even REACH for that fucking calculator, I’ll report you to the thought police, you massive bigot. Oh, you somehow guessed what my number is? It just became five digits. Maybe I’ll throw in a floating-point just to check that you’re paying attention. If you can’t even extend this basic courtesy to me then it’s obvious that you’re a literal Nazi, and you should just, like, not, OK? It just became six digits. You’d better get it right first time, and every time, or I’ll sue you and have you arrested for hate speech. See you in court, Numerophobe.I miss you, cummy. I miss the feeling of being able to come home and go on mobile to look at your sweet copying of copypastas for mobile users. I’m sad, cum cums. My life has gone nowhere since you left us. Please, cummy, come back. For all of us.ᶦ ˢʷᵉᵃʳ ᵗᵒ ᵍᵒᵈ ᶦᶠ ᵃᶰʸ ᵒᶠ ʸᵒᵘ FUCKS ᶜᵒᵖʸ ᵃᶰᵈ ᵖᵃˢᵗᵉ ᵗʰᶦˢ ʸᵒᵘ ʷᶦᶫᶫ ᵇᵉ ᶦᶰ ˢᵉʳᶦᵒᵘˢ ᵗʳᵒᵘᵇᶫᵉMemes, analogously to genes, vary in their aptitude to replicate; successful memes remain and spread, whereas unfit ones stall and are forgotten. Thus memes that prove more effective at replicating and surviving are selected in the meme pool.

Memes first need retention. The longer a meme stays in its hosts, the higher its chances of propagation are. When a host uses a meme, the meme's life is extended. The reuse of the neural space hosting a certain meme's copy to host different memes is the greatest threat to that meme's copy.

A meme which increases the longevity of its hosts will generally survive longer. On the contrary, a meme which shortens the longevity of its hosts will tend to disappear faster. However, as hosts are mortal, retention is not sufficient to perpetuate a meme in the long term; memes also need transmission.

Life-forms can transmit information both vertically (from parent to child, via replication of genes) and horizontally (through viruses and other means). Memes can replicate vertically or horizontally within a single biological generation. They may also lie dormant for long periods of time.I used to masturbate onto birds at a local park. Not a thing that I'm particularly proud of but I became quite good at it. I was taking zinc supplements so I was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me. For anyone interested here is your best strategy. first, you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender. I found a short kind of channel area where I saw the pigeons would congregate. Next, you arouse yourself. I was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go. After you're good an horny, you get some bread. My pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain. Fat, unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that. Once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed, whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you. use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum. I was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet. You wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence. At this point, you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust. Now you're finally ready to cum on your bird. This is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds, so you have to be subtle. Once you master a technique, you simply wind it up and let it go, aiming depending on your past cumming experiences. I always came high so I would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face. It's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling, seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city. Either way I haven't done it in years but every now and then I catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds, cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me.During labour 😫😭🤬😱👶, the pain 😰 is so great that a woman 👩👩🏾👱‍♀️ can almost imagine 🤔 💭 what an epic gamer 😎🕹 feels when they are asked to respect minorities 👴🏿👨‍❤️‍👨😤😡.I'm Harambe, and this is my zoo enclosure. I work here with my zoo keeper and my friend, cecil the lion. Everything in here has a story and a price. One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know WHO is gonna come over that fence.
Let me tell a story about my Walmart experience. I was actually just recently thinking about it.

We had a customer that we stopped up front as he had a TV in the cart and it was over $300. I asked to see his receipt and he refused. I insisted as it was a fairly expensive item and it was standard procedure to ask for the receipt upon the customer's exit.

Now I should tell you that this guy was very obviously Muslim. Nothing wrong with that, but it is important later.

So I ask for his receipt and he tells me "you too" and begins to walk off. I hollered "sir, please may I see your receipt? It's just standard practice." He turned around and had one of the scariest looks I have ever seen. He walked back to me with receipt in hand and said "Youre the reason why."

He crumpled up the receipt and threw it in my face and walked out. Now he had paid with a credit card so his name was on the receipt. His name? Osama Bin Laden. The date? 9/10/2001.

I'll never forget it. I had the bastard and I let him go. I've always been on the side of "traps are gay" but I think Alex Jones watching trap porn might prove they aren't. Let's look at it rationally. He has access to the highest quality water filters, capable of vaporizing the big gay down at the nano-molecular level, leaving his water 100% heterosexual. Therefore, if he was watching trap porn, it had to somehow get through those water filters. Doing a big think right now

We all know I really run things around here.6 months, 180 days of semen retention.

My last post was about my 100 day account. I thought it was going to be the last post I made here.

But I just had to come back and document my experience.

Experience

I have undergone a complete transformation process. The man I was one day one is not the man I am at 180 days. My life has changed. Friends who have not seen me in a while said I am vastly different. Family members say I am a man. Associates look up to me.

People admire me.

People understand I carry myself with respect. People admire my poise and my grace.

I gave a speech the other week and people came up to me and said I was one of the best public speakers they had ever seen. They are drawn in by my magnetism.

My physique is a classic masculine shape. My shoulders are bigger and it's like I have more muscle definition. The work in the gym is key, but semen retention gives it that edge.

Every moment of my day is filled with bliss and euphoria. I see wonder in everything.

Talking to women is effortless. Women, they come to me. But I am committed to completing 1 year of semen retention to see how far I can take this.

Benefits

All of the benefits you expect, amplified. This is a new level. I have truly ascended. More confidence, more focus, more drive, more motivation. More... clarity. I feel crystal clear. Before, it was as if there was a "screen" in front of my reality. That screen is no longer there. I am whole again.

I have had a time where I stayed up 24 hours in an attempt to get a project done. I could not have done it without semen retention.

Time has slowed down. One minute feels like one hour to me. But it is not agony. It is filled with awareness. I feel as if I am completely conscious. Every hour in my day is filled with useful or recouperative activity.

I sleep easily and effortlessly. My eyes shine. I look in the mirror and I love myself.

I radiate happiness, calm, and peace.

I will hit one year of semen retention and then I will decide to release with a woman of my choosing.

I just didn't know life could be like this. It is a feeling that you will only get when you get to this point.

I could send you a postcard from this land but you will like the view better when you get here.People who make fun of people for being virgins...


Like what the actual fudge. They are human too, you mundanefudger. I would rather play my video games than try to spread my genes or strenuously exert myself. I just don’t feel like it. So shut up, thanks. If I could choose between maximum rank in Overwatch and having sex, I would choose the former.

I don’t want to risk an unwanted pregnancy or getting an STD.

Do you know why you make fun of Virgins? Because you are so insecure yourself. Or maybe you’re ignorant of the fact that the one you are insulting is a human being just like you.

SMH. IF YOU CANNOT BRING YOURSELF UP, BRING SOMEONE ELSE DOWN. pathetic

why people gotta be so mean? What hurt you? Seriously!

TO VIRGIN HATERS: FUDGE UKELELE

like people who hate virgins need to chill the fudge down and mind their own business
Whats this?It simply is not true? I know, butterflies, more important than 300 deaths which are based on the number of high school, I have peace.

Monkeys trained to fight, and I'm not a military sniper. You anything, but it was not. We wanted to determine the sex. I mean, I see the face of the earth.

If you think you can find something on the Internet? Evo cars. Be prepared for hidden spy network in the United States to attack the larvae of intellectual property rights, I must say better. The storm destroyed painful memories. Half of the children died. You can do it anywhere and I can already killed hundreds of hands.
This is wrong, but smaller oil reserves, like an old man "that some phones Navy to play ugly."
But now we can not pay ridiculous prices. I do not want to disrupt their wounds.

Half of the children died.Dearest Cummy, 

Sorrow has overcome the community. What’s the point in posting if you won’t be here to see it? Alas, with a heavy heart and tearful eyes I will carry on. For if I give up, I will not be here to witness your return. Come home, Cummy.

Love forever,

r/copypastaI feel like Shrek is a metaphor for racism in America. 

The entire premise of the movie is about a bunch of "strange" creatures who are evicted from their homes by no less a white man, Lord Farquaad. They are forced to go back to the swamp, which could be a metaphor for refugees being deported to Middle Eastern or African countries. Farquaad discriminates against them massively, to the point where they are sold as pets, obviously symbolic of the slave trade in the 1700s-1800s.

 Now, Shrek is a great protagonist because he symbolises diversity, seeing as he is not European, East Asian, South Asian, African or Middle Eastern, he is green. This shows how not one race is superior to the other, and how together each race must overcome trials and tribulations together.

 Now, take Shrek's good friend Donkey. Considering Donkey's background, he is obviously a slave, and Shrek, while first being quite against him, eventually accepts him as a great friend and ally. This is a good example of the "good samaritan" nature that many people began adopting in the past few decades after realising that African Americans were no different to them. 

Once Shrek reaches Farquaad's castle (symbolic of the empire that white colonialists built up over the years), he can easily take down Farquaad's knights. This shows us that even if certain races are discriminated against and treated like garbage, they are not bound to chains, and can rise up against hatred if they have the right motivation. 

Now, one of the greatest moments in the entire movie, perhaps one of the most touching and beautiful moments in the history of cinema in its entirety, is Shrek's monologue to Donkey. After a long conversation about life and society, Shrek explains to Donkey how he wishes people could understand, that everyone has layers. Donkey takes a while to understand, but he soon understands. Each and every person on earth has layers, and these layers go extremely deep. You can never understand how someone truly feels because they have so many layers, and no matter the colour of our skin or how we look, we all have layers, just like an onion. 

Next comes Fiona. Fiona is a very interesting character, because she turns from human to ogre at night. This symbolises how she doesn't think she can be her true self, and needs to present herself as "white" in order to be respected and taken seriously, and she can only be herself when no one else is around. Now, when Shrek meets Fiona, it's a symbol of when slavery was finally abolished, as they can finally find hope, just like Shrek found hope in Fiona, yet the dragon represents Jim Crow and segregation laws that would soon follow. However, soon enough, the dragon is tamed by Donkey, which represents when these laws began to ease and eventually end, the beast is nearly tamed but still lingers, referencing how there is still a great deal of racial tension to this day.

 Now, the final part of the movie which I think shows this theme greatly is the very end when we see Farquaad about to marry Fiona, a symbol of how colonists nearly took away all rights of other races, but in the very end, the dragon eats him, signifying the colonies being liberated and the start of a new era, and when Fiona turns completely ogre, it shows how she stops putting on a facade and accepts herself for who she really is.

Just kidding, but you scroll faster than a Bugatti drives! .lol😂

Trolled 😂I love pussy. I absolutely ADORE it. I cannot get enough of it. Lil Wayne’s lyrics are my spirit animal. I could spend all day with my head in between someone’s knees, I could day happy when I find a woman who will spend sun up to sun down with me eating her out. The smell the taste the feel the way it makes her moan ALL OF IT. My one bone to pick with god is that the laws of physics are such that I can’t get even closer to it. So why is it, when we’re in the heat of the moment, I tell them to sit on my face, and they gingerly rest it an inch above my mouth? Why make your legs keep up that kind of squat? I want you to sit down and relax, I want you to grind up against my lips, let my nose brisk your clit and your thighs to give me friction burns on my ears. I want to look death in the face while nearly suffocating. And yet, when I ask this, I’ve gotten “I don’t want to crush you!”

That. Is. The. Point.

So to my next partner, don’t dangle yourself an inch above my mouth (unless you’re purposely trying to tease me), don’t give yourself a leg cramp trying to give me a feather’s weight of pressure of yourself. I want to be connected with you, I want to be so enveloped by you that I can’t handle it.A 👶baby👶🍼 was born🚼 in 🚑hospital 🏥

B O U N C Y B O Y EFemales are nothing but sex objects. I have devoted every single second of my life to getting laid. I lift, I shower, I have a nice haircut, I wear nice clothes, I drive a cool car, I can play drums, guitar and keyboards, I have approached girsl, I have soialized, I have a physics deegree, I know how to code, I know 3 languages, I have done nosleep, I take cold showers, I am ambidexterous and I'm good at cooking.

I am also a very assertive and confident man. I am a genouine man, the epitome of masculinity. So why am I a virgin? It's because we live in a fucking cucked society. Women fuck men solely based on looks. Sluts are so picky nowdays that you may need to meet thousands of bitches till you find one to ride you.

If we had patriarchy I would be married to a prime virgin stacy by now. I'm sick an tired of seeing pathetic betas on this sub who fap to tranny porn have loving girlfriends while true alphas like me get absolutely nothing. Men&gt;women. We are entitled to sex to. I have a dick and I would like to use it for once.CummyBot is coming out of the closet

We ALL have lost a good friend. You all know whom I am talking about. Our very own CummyBot2000. He hasn't made any comments in 19 hours. Does anyone know what has happend to the valuable member of our community? What is to come of our dear CummyBot2000??I am now verbalizing my judgement that is contended to the Female Homo-Sapien in which supplied birth to you, the scholar; the explanandum for which originates from when a spermatozoan cell encroaches upon a Female egg cell originating from the Female's ovaries and subsiding exclusively inside of a singular fallopian tube; the spermatozoan cells of which originated from a Male's erect genitalia, consisting of several parts, including the outermost interlayer of connective tissue cells known as the prepuce, in which protects the internal mesomorphic cytoarchitectonics, like the glans penis, the corpora, the corpus cavernosum, the urogenital apparatus, in which excretes urine consisting of dissolved toxins and one hydrogen molecule compounded with two oxygen molecules. The urogenital apparatus can also discharge spermatozoan cells during a period of sexual arousal. During this period of sexual arousal, caused by a complex reciprocation of psychological, neural, vascular, and endocrine factors, the Male's genitalia becomes hypertrophied and firm, causing the Male's genitalia to protrude outwards, leading to a diminutive amount of sexual arousal to the Male. When the Male's genitalia is thrusted into the Female vagina several times in a high-velocity fashion, it causes the testes stored in the Male's scrotum to excrete millions of spermatozoan cells, in which travel downwards into an ejaculatory duct, and upwards through the Male urethra, eventually reaching its way into the Female vagina, into the cervical canal, inside of the Female uterus, and finally reaching the Female fallopian tubes in which the Female's eggs produced by the ovaries lie. This is otherwise known as vaginal penetration. Once this process is completed, millions of spermatozoan cells locomote to inseminate the Female's egg cell; whilst invigorating the Female glans clitoridis causing a multitudinousness amount of sexual arousal to the Female. When the egg has been inseminated, the spermatozoan cell's chromosome syncretizes with the Female Homo-Sapien's egg, otherwise known as an X or a Y chromosome. If the X chromosome of the Female Homo-Sapien's egg cell is amalgamated with an X chromosome from the spermatozoan cell, the fetus metamorphoses into a Female. Otherwise, if the X chromosome of the Female's egg cell is amalgamated with a Y chromosome from the spermatozoan cell, the fetus metamorphoses into a Male. After a hebdomad amount of days, the Female may experience side-phenomenons such as mood oscillations. This is when the Female knows that her egg has been inseminated. After about forty weeks, a anthropomorphous fetus is ultimately born into existence. The judgement on which a Homo-Sapien of Male gender is sexually attracted to a Homo-Sapien of Male gender was condemned prehistorically as a mental disorder. The accusation of homosexuality is unremarkably utilized as a vituperation to slander the person in question of being sexually attracted to Male Homo-Sapiens while being a Male Homo-Sapien; however, in actuality, the Homo-Sapien's sexual predisposition could be not for the Male gender, nor could they be a Male, as the party in question being accused of such accusations, the Female Homo-Sapien that has given birth to you, the scholar, has to be a Female, as the only way to give birth to a Homo-Sapien is for a Male to inseminate a Female's egg. Therefore, this statement could have been transliterated to the fact that the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar, is sexually attracted to Female Homo-Sapiens, in which case could not be possible unless the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar, disassociated with the Male that gave the spermatozoan cells needed to inseminate the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar's eggs. This vilification could also be nullified by the information that you, the scholar, have prior cognitive content that the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar is not sexually attracted to Female Homo-Sapiens. However, if this amendment is genuine, and the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar, has sexual relations and has or has not had sexual intercourse with a Female of differing derivations than of you, the scholar, of which said sexual intercourse is preformed by the sexual stimulation of either the Female rectum or clitoris, often by either using the Female tongue, made up entirely of muscle, whilst salivating via salivary glands located within the Female mouth, and dragging the Female tongue around the area that the Female wants to stimulate, often giving intermittent sexual arousal to both Female Homo-Sapiens that are preforming the sexual intercourse, or by manipulating the Female phalanges to provocatively fondle and tease either one or both Females. When ones own genitalia is being sexually stimulated for sexual arousal, it may be called self-stimulation, and Female self-stimulation during Female on Female sexual intercourse is mostly acknowledged as a commonness during Female on Female sexual intercourse. When stimulated properly using the Female phalanges, it may result in both sides having a brobdingnagian amount of sexual arousal. If one Female or both Females have a very brobdingnagian amount of sexual arousal, it may result in sexual climax, characterized by extremely intense groaning and moaning as the Female in question is experiencing a complex amount of muscular contractions around the pelvic region. If the statement above accurately describes the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar, then your defense against this critisism is nullified. Otherwise, if you and the Female in which gave birth to you, the scholar, shows signs of heterosexuality, bisexuality, pansexuality, polysexuality, monosexuality, allosexuality, gynosexuality, demisexuality, or asexuality, then all of the amendments and arguments enumerated above does not apply to you, the scholar.GAYBLADE GAYBLADE SUCK MY DICK

Thunderf00t is a moron and is going to have to eat his words when this becomes a reality. What were his credentials again? If you believe a youtuber instead of people like Elon Musk and top engineers from the top universities who are actually making this a reality, your also a moron. Good luck  with your ignorant opinions, lack of analytical skills and sheep like mentality.﻿Imagine driving on the highway, you look down and see a fucking snake coming atcha from under the steering wheel! You freak shit and start swirving like wild before you realize that the snake is here to cause no ill will. She is friend, not foe. Her intent is not to harm. She has something much more sinister planned. She winks at you before unzipping your pants and sliding them down to your ankles. She opens wide and takes your dick deep down her throat and into the pit of her stomach. She bobs. Up, down, up, down. You clench the steering wheel tightly, ready to explode. You cum so hard you shoot the snake clean off of your dick where she smashes on the windshield, coating it in a thin, translucent layer of cum and snake guts. She loved you intensely, if only for a brief moment. But now the moment has passed and you got a pile of cum and guts to clean.Johnny was always a strong boy. He has been so strong throughout all this, ever since the asbestos started ravishing his body. And even now in his final minutes he tried to be strong, for his parents sake. He knew his struggle was finally coming to an end and so did everyone else. His mother was weeping uncontrollably bit Johnny tried to make her smile one last time. "It's alright mum me pains comin to an end. I'll see you again in heaven. " 

Suddenly the ground starts shaking, the walls trembling. All glassware comes craahing off the shelves onto the floor, all windows shatter. In the distance, sirens. The sound of the shaking, breaking glass and mayhem outside come to an orgasmic climax as 🅱️en Sha🅱️iro bursts through the door.

"GOD IS NOT REAL AND NEITHER IS HEAVEN!" he shouts at the dying child.

LOGIC

FACTS

A vortex of triggered libtards opens, and Shapiro steps into it. It closes leaving behind just the destroyed hospice room with little Johnny and his parents. Knowing now there is no heaven, Johnny speaks his final words : " I am a liberal and this greatly upsets me". 

Johnny draws his terminal breath.

He flatlines.

All sound has been sucked from the room apart from the constant beep of the heartrate monitor.Day 74 of no fap

As I exited my vehicle to walk into work I caught scent of a female in heat 73.35 meters upwind. Because of the fog I couldn’t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid twenties, and healthy. My ultra attunated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5’6”. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me.

Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike.

I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinters starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth.

As I float into the the celestial abyss of the greater Crab Nebula I am not filled with regret for having left my world, but rather happiness for having left it a better place.

You’re welcome gentlemen"I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer"

Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline.

"Why not? Don't you like the internet?"

The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen.

"I just prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble."

The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. This is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding conviction...

"BAZINGA"

In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. Peace at last.Uh, fuck you buddy I'm 8 years old, love the show and the memes, and I've already ran thru more pussy than you could even dream about. Arthur is the shit and so is getting mad 3 ways almost every day.

Step up, bitch.ay yo what's up #logang today we're going to be heading in the #japanesesuicideforest here in japan, but first of all make sure to smash that like button, share this video, and subscribe for more vlogs like this one right here, also make sure to follow me on twitter, instagram google +, and like my page on facebook and pintrest. before heading in here i just wanna say suicide is not a joke but is that a dead body i'm not fucking with ya'll let's get the camera in there. as you can see this person is dead if you don't want to end up like him make sure you stay subscribed you know he probably ain't have no friends but if your in the #logang you know logan is your best friend haha chilling anyways thanks for watching guys and i won't be monetizing this video but make sure to check out my merch in the description, and dont forget to like share and subscribe and peace out #logang hahaSo guys I have a story. One time I was minding my own business when out of nowhere my phone starting getting tons of notifications. I opened it up and noticed that everyone was applauding me for "coming out". I was naturally intrigued so I opened up the notifications and notice that I, 50 minutes go, had called myself gay. I swiftly had to delete that post, and explain to my family and friends that I am not gay. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my boyfriend had made that post on my account.The thing I really like about Planes is that we learn that WWII happened in the Cars universe. Which means there was a Cars Hitler, a Cars holocaust, a Cars Pacific War, a Cars D-Day, a Cars nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a Cars Rape of Nanking, a Cars Battle of Iwo Jima...

This leads to so many important questions, like: were the Cars Little Boy and Fat Man nukes sentient? Was it a suicide mission? Are ALL Cars nuclear weapons sentient? Did Tsar Bomba have a personality?

What kind of car was Car Hitler? A VW? A forklift?

Was there a Cars 9/11? Were the planes hijacked, or were the planes themselves radicalized?

I could go on

Edit: I just realized a Cars 9/11 gives a whole new layer of meaning to the phrase "let's roll"And they will be the last winner. United Nations 300 million, aluminum Czech Republic.

\*If im Not Online For 6 Or More Days It Means Im Probably Dead Or I Just Surrendered My Life*
I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge, and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor’s office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I’ve trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius’s wrath. then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting it’s prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don’t have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here, so the doctor gets me off and it’s covered by taxpayers. That’s my fetish.He masturbates in the shower often and whenever he does it clogs up the drain. His cum is really thick and it's so fucking difficult to get rid of unless you pick up the filter with your hand and it smells so fucking bad. So either I a pick up the drain and have me fingers touch his sperm or I just take a shower anyways and the water cant go down the drain so water diluted with my brothers sperm is covering my feet. Yeah and I can't tell him unless I want to get in an awkward af conversation about is cum and him masturbating.

He also has huge fucking shits that clog the toilet and never checks if the toilet is clogged after he flushes. And even if he did, he doesn't try to unclog with the toilet with the plunger ever so my dad has to do it. A couple times the pipes were leaking or something because there was water dripping in the living room (which is right above the bathroom) because of his fat shits.I'm just a stupid little slut who wants to be fucked senselessly. I will be anything you desire, as you empty your huge melon sized balls into this small and fragile body mine. My entire body will be served as your pathetic cumdump toy. I will worship your huge and monstrous cock and make it my life. My belly can be filled with your smelly cum or I could bear your kids with my womb. I will be your little sex toy. Use and abuse me as you see fit because my only purpose in life is to be filled like the useless and filthy cumdump slut I am. Add me if you want to be drained fully. Your perfect little whore is waiting for you, daddy &lt;3.There wived a certain mwan, in Wussia wong ago

will post part two only if this gets enough reaccshello im a cute person with a manga avatar, i have nine friends on steam and i link my equally as degenerate significant other on my profile with a unicode heart

my name is minimalistic and ominous, if you insult me, i'll dox you and then bask in my silent glory

i am a neet with no ambitions, my parents hate me, i dropped out of high school, and im a self proclaimed genius, but i never express it

my favorite five groups are "/d/ is for dickgirls", "sad sleepy anime", "sleep forever", "thigh high lolis" and a group where the only members are me and my significant other, set to invite only 

my steam backgrounds are dark and grey, and only 12 cents and maybe even 12 dollars if people try to copy me

my significant other is monotoned, girly sounding, anorexic, and shy, we sleep skype together and go on skype dates, i love them so much as i hug my parent's ipad tightly, drifting away at 2 amHaha yes thank you for noticing my style! It's unconventional for sure, but to be honest, not much thought goes into it. I just kind of put on whatever is in my closet. I guess I just get lucky. Or maybe it's my 150 iq but that's neither here nor there 😉. I always get complimented for the shirts I wear, especially the Rick and Morty one. I rarely ever wear my comic tees anymore, because they are so juvenile. I even told my mom not to buy me any. Yes, my mom buys my clothes. There's nothing wrong with that and if you think there is, then you're just like the rest of the feeble minded thots that can't seem to grasp that I have better things to do with my time than to go shopping. Ok so heres what happened. This leftTARD dem-o-LIB feminazi is on stage talking about how she has too many ovaries or whatever. Then, ben shapiro comes out, fukin jacked as fuck, wearing a sleeveless suit, and straight up punches her right in the FACE. And she fukin DIES right there.

There I was, sitting in a packed theater of eager Marvel fans waiting to see a movie that they've waited years to see. As the movie progressed, I noticed the theater was not enjoying the movie. Time passed, 30 minutes, 1 hours, 2 hours, until a very special moment. During the final fight of the movie, as many people were starting to visibly tear up from a disappointing Avengers movie, we witnessed the greatest movie event of all time. Right as Thanos was about to kill one of the heroes, Gibby leapt from the bushes and attacked him. The theater started to whisper "Is that really him?" The crowd started to cheer louder and louder until I witnessed history. The crowd was chanting "Gibby! Gibby! Gibby!" Thanos uttered the line to Gibby "You'll die soon enough fatty." The crowd was aghast. I was on the edge of my seat. The theater was starting to shake. Gibby looked straight into the camera and ripped his shirt off. I grabbed my soda so hard that it busted onto the man next to me. He was too caught up to notice. The cheering in the theater that night was the loudest recorded noise in human history. Every single man, woman, and child started tearing up from the beauty of the scene. Nobody expected this when they bought their ticket. A shirtless Gibby then bopped Thanos with his stomach, obliterating him instantly. Gibby looks into the camera, winks, and credits roll. The crowd started roaring and continued clapping for 30 minutes after the movie was over. As I was leaving, I saw an old man with the expression that his life was changed. I asked him what he was thinking of, and he said that the shirtless Gibby scene gave him the knowledge he required to solve an important formula. That man was Albert Einstein.My ultimate fantasy is kidnapping a cute boy and locking him up in my basement. I will let him consume nothing but soylent, estrogen, and milk mixed with my semen.

Every day when I catch him about to sleep in bed, I will enter his room, manhandle him into a chair, restrain him, and put him in front of a monitor that is showing terabytes of trap porn and sissy hypno videos.

As the training progress it will get more advanced, at the end he will also be locked in a chastity cage with vibrators up his ass, taped to his dick, and taped to his nipples.

As he falls more and more for my jewish psyop I will leave dildos and other sex toys around his room for him to play with.

Near the end of his training I will remove all the toys from his room and leave makeup, shaving tools, and dresses in his room.

I will deny him any kind of pleasure for a week straight and when he is completely lust filled I will descend into his room with nothing but a mask on.What is so funny about copypasta? Someone put a lot of time in writing out a wall of text, and all you do is just copy and paste it? Unbelievable. Freaking unbelievable. It is so fucking disrespectful for the original writter to have his thoughts repeated over and over just for some kind of sick joke. You fools know the CSU copypasta, right? People chuckle at it because he was "very mad". Well, think about it, motherfucker. What if he WAS very mad? What if he actually had feelings and his day was ruined? Ever think about it like that? No, of course not. You tools just took his words over and over and used it for shits and giggles. How fucking rude. At this point, my 10 page essay on why I think Brawl is ass could be used as a copypasta. That is just fucking wrong on so many levels. I'm not going to write out a copypasta myself, because I don't want my words to be shat out over and over again. I'm just expressing my thoughts and feelings on the abuse of copypasta. It just needs to fucking stop.😀😃😄😁😆😅😂🤣☺️😌😇🙂🙃😉😌😍😘😗😙😚😋😜😝😛🤑🤗🤓😎🤡🤠😏😒😞😔😟😕🙁☹️😣😖😫😩😤😠😡😶😐😑😯😦😧😮😲😵😳😱😨😰😢😥🤤😭😓😪😴🙄🤔🤥😬🤐🤢🤧😷🤒🤕😈👿👹👺💩👻💀☠️👽👾🤖🎃😺😸😹😻😼😽🙀😿😾👐🙌👏🤝👍👎👊✊️🤛🤜🤞✌️🤘👌👈👉👆👇☝️✋️💪🖕✍️🤳💅💍💄💋👄👅👂👃👣👁👀🗣👤👥👶👦👧👨👩👱🏻‍♀️👱👴👵👲👳‍♀️👳👮‍♀️👮👷‍♀️👷💂‍♀️🕵️‍♀️🕵️👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️👩🏿‍🌾👨‍🌾👩‍🍳👨‍🍳👩‍🎓👨‍🎓👩‍🎤👨‍🎤👩‍🏫👨‍🏫👩‍🏭👨‍🏭👩‍💻👨‍💻👩‍💼👨‍💼👩‍🔧👨‍🔧👩‍🔬👨‍🔬👩‍🎨👨‍🎨👩‍🚒👨‍🚒👨‍✈️👩‍✈️👩‍🚀👨‍🚀👩‍⚖️👨‍⚖️🤶🎅👸🤴👰🤵👼🤰🙇‍♀️🙇💁💁‍♂️🙅🙅‍♂️🙆🏻🙆‍♂️🙋🙋‍♂️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♂️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️🙎🙎‍♂️🙍🙍‍♂️💇💇‍♂️💆💆‍♂️🕴💃🕺👯👯‍♂️🚶‍♀️🚶🏃‍♀️🏃👫👭👬💑👩‍❤️‍👩👨‍❤️‍👨💏👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👪👨‍👩‍👧👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👩‍👩‍👦👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👩‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👨‍👦👨‍👨‍👧👨‍👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👧👩‍👦👩‍👧👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👦👨‍👧👨‍👧‍👦👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👧‍👧👚👕👖👔👗👙👘👠👡👢👞👟👒🎩🎓👑⛑🎒👝👛👜💼👓🕶🌂☂️🐶🐱🐹🐭🐰🦊🐻🐼🐨🐯🦁🐮🐷🐽🐸🐵🙈🙉🙊🐒🐔🐧🐦🐤🐣🐥🦆🦅🦉🦇🐺🐗🐴🦄🐝🐛🦋🐌🐚🐞🐜🕷🕸🐢🐍🦎🦂🦀🦑🐙🦐🐠🐟🐡🐬🦈🐳🐋🐊🐆🐅🐃🐂🐄🦌🐪🐫🐘🦏🦍🐎🐖🐐🐏🐑🐕🐩🐈🐓🦃🕊🐇🐁🐀🐿🐾🐉🐲🌵🎄🌲🌳🌴🌱🌿☘️🍀🎍🎋🍃🍂🍁🍄🌾💐🌷🌹🥀🌻🌼🌸🌺🌎🌍🌏🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔🌚🌝🌞🌛🌜🌙💫⭐️🌟✨⚡️🔥💥☄️☀️🌤⛅️🌥🌦🌈☁️🌧⛈🌩🌨☃️⛄️❄️🌬💨🌪🌫🌊💧💦☔️🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇🍓🍈🍒🍑🍍🥝🥑🍅🍆🥒🥕🌽🌶🥔🍠🌰🥜🍯🥐🍞🥖🧀🥚🍳🥓🥞🍤🍗🍖🍕🌭🍔🍟🥙🌮🌯🥗🥘🍝🍜🍲🍥🍣🍱🍛🍙🍚🍘🍢🍡🍧🍨🍦🍰🎂🍮🍭🍬🍫🍿🍩🍪🥛🍼☕️🍵🍶🍺🍻🥂🍷🥃🍸🍹🍾🥄🍴🍽⚽️🏀🏈⚾️🎾🏐🏉🎱🏓🏸🥅🏒🏑🏏⛳️🏹🎣🥊🥋⛸🎿⛷🏂🏋️‍♀️🏋️🤺🤼‍♀️🤼‍♂️🤸‍♀️🤸‍♂️⛹️‍♀️⛹️🤾‍♀️🤾‍♂️🏌️‍♀️🏌️🏄‍♀️🏄🏊‍♀️🏊🤽‍♀️🤽‍♂️🚣‍♀️🚣🏇🚴‍♀️🚴🚵‍♀️🚵🎽🏅🎖🥇🥈🥉🏆🏵🎗🎫🎟🎪🤹‍♀️🤹‍♂️🎭🎨🎬🎤🎧🎼🎹🥁🎷🎺🎸🎻🎲🎯🎳🎮🎰🚗🚕🚙🚌🚎🏎🚓🚑🚒🚐🚚🚛🚜🛴🚲🛵🏍🚨🚔🚍🚘🚖🚡🚠🚟🚃🚋🚞🚝🚄🚅🚈🚂🚆🚇🚊🚉🚁🛩✈️🛫🛬🚀🛰💺🛶⛵️🛥🚤🛳⛴🚢⚓️🚧⛽️🚏🚦🚥🗺🗿🗽⛲️🗼🏰🏯🏟🎡🎢🎠⛱🏖🏝⛰🏔🗻🌋🏜🏕⛺️🛤🛣🏗🏭🏠🏡🏘🏚🏢🏬🏣🏤🏥🏦🏨🏪🏫🏩💒🏛⛪️🕌🕍🕋⛩🗾🎑🏞🌅🌄🌠🎇🎆🌇🌆🏙🌃🌌🌉🌁⌚️📱📲💻⌨️🖥🖨🖱🖲🕹🗜💽💾💿📀📼📷📸📹🎥📽🎞📞☎️📟📠📺📻🎙🎚🎛⏱⏲⏰🕰⌛️⏳📡🔋🔌💡🔦🕯🗑🛢💸💵💴💶💷💰💳💎⚖️🔧🔨⚒🛠⛏🔩⚙️⛓🔫💣🔪🗡⚔️🛡🚬⚰️⚱️🏺🔮📿💈⚗️🔭🔬🕳💊💉🌡🚽🚰🚿🛁🛀🛎🔑🗝🚪🛋🛏🛌🖼🛍🛒🎁🎈🎏🎀🎊🎉🎎🏮🎐✉️📩📨📧💌📥📤📦🏷📪📫📬📭📮📯📜📃📄📑📊📈📉🗒🗓📆📅📇🗃🗳🗄📋📁📂🗂🗞📰📓📔📒📕📗📘📙📚📖🔖🔗📎🖇📐📏📌📍✂️🖊🖋✒️🖌🖍📝✏️🔍🔎🔏🔐🔓🔒❤️💛💚💙💜🖤💔❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝💟☮️✝️☪️🕉☸️✡️🔯🕎☯️☦️⛎♈️♉️♊️♋️♌️♍️♎️♏️♐️♑️♒️♓️🆔⚛️🉑☢️☣️📴📳🈶🈚️🈸🈺🈷✴️🆚💮🉐㊙️㊗️🈴🈵🈹🈲🅰️🅱️🆎🆑🅾️🆘❌⭕️🛑⛔️📛🚫💯💢♨️🚷🚯🚳🚱🔞📵🚭❗️❕❓❔‼️⁉️🔅🔆〽️⚠️🚸🔱⚜️🔰♻️✅🈯️💹❇️✳️❎🌐💠Ⓜ️🌀💤🏧🚾♿️🅿️🈳🈂🛂🛃🛄🛅🚹🚺🚼🚻🚮🎦📶🈁🔣ℹ️🔤🔡🔠🆖🆗🆙🆒🆕🆓0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣4️⃣5️⃣6️⃣7️⃣8️⃣9️⃣🔟🔢#️⃣*️⃣▶️⏸⏯⏹⏺⏭⏮⏩⏪⏫⏬◀️🔼🔽➡️⬅️⬆️⬇️↗️↘️↙️↖️↕️↔️↪️↩️⤴️⤵️🔀🔁🔂🔄🔃🎵🎶➕➖➗✖️💲💱™©®〰➰➿🔚🔙🔛🔝🔜✔️☑️🔘⚪️⚫️🔴🔵🔺🔻🔸🔸🔹🔶🔷🔳🔲▪️▫️◾️◽️◼️◻️⬛️⬜️🔈🔇🔉🔊🔔🔕📣📢👁‍🗨💬💭🗯♠️♣️♥️♦️🃏🎴🀄️🕐🕑🕒🕓🕔🕕🕖🕗🕘🕙🕚🕛🕜🕝🕞🕟🕠🕡🕢🕣🕤🕥🕦🕧🏳🏴🏁🚩🏳️‍🌈🇦🇫🇦🇽🇦🇱🇩🇿🇦🇸🇦🇩🇦🇴🇦🇮🇦🇶🇦🇬🇦🇷🇦🇲🇦🇼🇦🇺🇦🇹🇦🇿🇧🇸🇧🇭🇧🇩🇧🇧🇧🇾🇧🇪🇧🇿🇧🇯🇧🇲🇧🇹🇧🇴🇧🇦🇧🇼🇧🇷🇮🇴🇻🇬🇧🇳🇧🇬🇧🇫🇧🇮🇰🇭🇨🇲🇨🇦🇮🇨🇨🇻🇧🇶🇰🇾🇨🇫🇹🇩🇨🇱🇨🇳🇨🇽🇨🇨🇨🇴🇰🇲🇨🇬🇨🇩🇨🇰🇨🇷🇨🇮🇭🇷🇨🇺🇨🇼🇨🇾🇨🇿🇩🇰🇩🇯🇩🇲🇩🇴🇪🇨🇪🇬🇸🇻🇬🇶🇪🇷🇪🇪🇪🇹🇪🇺🇫🇰🇫🇴🇫🇯🇫🇮🇫🇷🇬🇫🇵🇫🇹🇫🇬🇦🇬🇲🇬🇪🇩🇪🇬🇭🇬🇮🇬🇷🇬🇱🇬🇩🇬🇵🇬🇺🇬🇹🇬🇬🇬🇳🇬🇼🇬🇾🇭🇹🇭🇳🇭🇰🇭🇺🇮🇸🇮🇳🇮🇩🇮🇷🇮🇶🇮🇪🇮🇲🇮🇱🇮🇹🇯🇲🇯🇵🎌🇯🇪🇯🇴🇰🇿🇰🇪🇰🇮🇽🇰🇰🇼🇰🇬🇱🇦🇱🇻🇱🇧🇱🇸🇱🇷🇱🇾🇱🇮🇱🇹🇱🇺🇲🇴🇲🇰🇲🇬🇲🇼🇲🇾🇲🇻🇲🇱🇲🇹🇲🇭🇲🇶🇲🇷🇲🇺🇾🇹🇲🇽🇫🇲🇲🇩🇲🇨🇲🇪🇲🇸🇲🇦🇲🇿🇲🇲🇳🇦🇳🇷🇳🇵🇳🇱🇳🇨🇳🇿🇳🇮🇳🇪🇳🇬🇳🇺🇳🇫🇰🇵🇲🇵🇳🇴🇴🇲🇵🇰🇵🇼🇵🇸🇵🇦🇵🇬🇵🇾🇵🇪🇵🇭🇵🇳🇵🇱🇵🇹🇵🇷🇶🇦🇷🇪🇷🇴🇷🇺🇷🇼🇼🇸🇸🇲🇸🇹🇸🇦🇸🇳🇷🇸🇸🇨🇸🇱🇸🇬🇸🇽🇸🇰🇸🇮🇬🇸🇸🇧🇸🇴🇿🇦🇰🇷🇸🇸🇪🇸🇱🇰🇧🇱🇸🇭🇰🇳🇱🇨🇵🇲🇻🇨🇸🇩🇸🇷🇸🇿🇸🇪🇨🇭🇸🇾🇹🇼🇹🇯🇹🇿🇹🇭🇹🇱🇹🇬🇹🇰🇹🇴🇹🇹🇹🇳🇹🇷🇹🇲🇹🇨🇹🇻🇻🇮🇺🇬🇺🇦🇦🇪🇬🇧🇺🇸🇺🇾🇺🇿🇻🇺🇻🇦🇻🇪🇻🇳🇼🇫🇪🇭🇾🇪🇿🇲🇿🇼when a girl buys a vibrator, its seen as a bit of naughty fun. BUT when a guy orders a 240 Volt FuckMaster Pro 5000 blowup latex doll with 6 speed pulsating vagina, elasticized anus with non-drip semen collection tray, together with optional built in realistic orgasm scream surround sound system, hes called a pervert?All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery?

I sexually identify as a single, Pringle, ready to mingle.

**So get to work!**When a woman gets a vibrator, it's seen as a bit of naughty fun. BUT when a guy orders a 240 volt Fuckmaster Pro 5000 blowup latex doll with 6 speed pulsating pussy, elasticized anus with non-drip semen collection tray, together with optional built-in realistic orgasm scream 7.1 surround system, he's called a pervert.Once upon a terribly dreadful time, there was a small cat-licking bird that lived on a lane by my house whose name was Charles just like every other soul, male or female, that lived on my smelly, stinky, orange, old, rotten, messy, busted cul-de-sac between Belmont and Rose which are both Gay-ass Streets Like North street or some shit that reminds me of a celebrity like Paris Hilton or some blonde loser that doesn't even know the capital of her own country, which is the United States of America aka: The U.S.A which is a pristine nation of beauty, opposing to a country as the country of Somalia and Belgium, a part of Europe, which doesn't even have a government, it's just in a complete state of anarchy just like my mind and soul which are both filled with outrageous nonsense that I'm typing down right now into some fat long sentence that probably makes no sense but who cares I'm trying to set some sort of weird record here like most ducks snorted or some weird thing like that and if I do set some sort of record I will be in the Guinness Book of World Records (though anti-American and pro European, a place of pitty and despair as Somalia is) which was always my dream because that book has a whole bunch a cool and weird stuff in it and I would Become famous and add to the weirdness of the book like some of their records which reminds me of the Rob & Big where Rob sets all of those skateboarding Records And Big Black eats bananas and donuts and three weeks later they both get plaques saying the record they set and I want to get one of those so that's why I'm writing all of this stuff down without ever using a period or some other sentence ending mark like an exclamation point or a question mark or any other symbol that could possibly end my streak of words that is really long now and would take me a while to count just like counting sheep which is supposed to put you to sleep but it really keeps you awake because you want to keep counting and counting until you don't know what comes after trillions, but that would take Years or something because it would take a while just to count a trillion seconds or minutes would be even worse just like how ducks are worse that geese because they are more aggressive around their young unlike great white sharks which are often eaten by their mothers when they are born and the ones who do make it out alive have no mother to teach them how to hunt or whatever because none of that matters because us human beings have mothers unless they die or run off with some CEO of a big company or someone else who makes a lot of money and then they leave you with your dad and you are jealous of your friends if you have any because they have moms and you don't because your mom was some greedy pig who wanted money but ended up only getting the money part and she bought drugs because she was depressed and ended up killing herself from an overdose and you wouldn't even know about it until you become some rich person and check the files somewhere and learn that she died of a overdose and you eyes get all teary and then you start crying because you know that you wouldn't be alive without that woman you called mom and I just found out right now that the longest sentence is like 10,000 words so I have a ways to go and you have to go with me so let's go to 6th gear and throw out some words like Emphysema which I had to do a report on in 4th grade because we had a ton of projects and this was the disease one and we chose diseases out of a hat and I came out with Emphysema which is a form of lung cancer which is 98% caused by smoking which reminds me of the way my dad describes smoking: "you get plant leaves, wrap them in paper, light it on fire and suck on it" which is normally a sentence but not today because I'm setting out on the quest for a long sentence that I'm typing up which reminds me of a story my grandpa told me about himself when he was "your age" about how they covered the letters on the type writers and they had to type so that they could memorize where the letters are on a type writer and my grandpa says he will never regret taking that class because it helped him out a lot when it came to typing and now a days he is not bad a typing at all because He is almost as fast as me because I am a pretty fast typer and writing this article isn't taking very long and expect being pretty far pretty soon at the pace I'm going right now so there are going to be some serious records getting busted when I'm finally finished writing this article on this dumb website which will probably end up huffing this article even though it is fun-packed and joyful and keeps the reader reading when they use that excuse to mom saying "just one more sentence" but that sentence is 10,000 words long and still continuing to go at a reasonable pace and it is going to shatter most of those long sentence records just like how the chargers are going to shatter the most consecutive years without a super bowl win record and I doubt that they will win one in the near future but they patriots are going to win some serious super bowls because they are the best team ever even better than the cowboys or 49ers and no one cares a bout them so go patriots and boo chargers even though I live in San Diego and Like the Padres I hate the Chargers because they are bad and the padres are bad too but I don't care because they are my favorite team and the dodgers are my least favorite along with the Yankees because the Yankees get a lot of money to spend and the padres and marlins get almost nothing and then the Yankees buy a-rod for a lot and the Rays get almost no money but are still fighting for first place this season without expensive players like Derek jeter or a-rod or johnny damon or whoever because they are an all around better team that can beat the Yankees even though the Yankees can beat the royals a lot who really suck because they suck more that the padres do and so do the mariners and Rockies even thought the Rockies went to the world series last year they lost and haven't stopped losing for a while now, either and they are last place in the nl west and that is where the padres used to be but they started hitting homeruns and winning games and are dong pretty good right now despite having little offense except for Adrian Gonzalez who is leading the NL in RBI's even though he is on the team who scores the least runs in the league but they are not last in homeruns though they are like 5 away or something but I’m not sure so screw that and let's talk about something fun like water or food or dirt or something but I think food is the best because their is a lot of things to talk about with food like you r favorite food which mine happens to be some spicy burrito form Chipotle mexican grill and it is very good just like this macaroni my mom made one time that had bread crumbs on top and it was very good like all of the food they serve on top chef which I wish I could be a judge for because they have a lot of good food on that show and it makes my mouth water whenever I watch it and that is why I watch it because the food is totally awesome and sometimes I hate the people but they end up getting eliminated like the Dance crews in France's Best Dance Crew which is a great show and you should watch it because people do good dancing like the JFrabbawockeez because they won the first season and they are very good just like supreme soul and So real crew and phresh select and super cr3w and I’m only at 1500 words right now so I have to write some serious stuff like a life biography about myself and anything I’ve ever done which includes going to big bear to ski, fishing, breathing, swimming, going, farting, eating, sleeping and a whole lot more stuff which reminds me of 4th grade again when my teacher was debating with the class whether "a lot" was one or two words and all of the kids including myself said one while the teacher said two and he was right and we were wrong but no one cared because we all had fun arguing about and I have fun arguing with my friends about football and not baseball because in baseball we all like the same team but in football I like the patriots and my friends like the chargers and the 49ers and the eagles and the saints but my team always woops their team's ass and they say that the patriots "cheat" and that's how they won even though the patriots just pwned their team and they suck and my team is good but we all agree when it comes to baseball because we all like the padres and we never really argue over anything in baseball which is my favorite sport and I play it and I am good a it and I want it to be my profession but I doubt that that will happen so my backup plan is being a cop because you get all of the benefits and you get paid after you retire which is good news and I would also like to be some government dude or something like that because they get the benefits too so it would be cool to work for the government which reminds me that my principal worked at the white house and taught the president email because he was the computer guy or something like that so h knows a whole bunch of computer crap like my dad and he is fat too so everyone makes fun of him and I think he huffs kittens too but I am not sure and about that and what the hell is up with all the n00b and kitten huffing on this gay ass website like all of the things like "the writer may have been huffing kittens" and stuff like that it really annoys the hell out of me just like other things such as when people clip their finger nails it makes that weird noise that get me all crazy and I hate it just like how me friend hates the sound of chalk on a chalkboard which I find soothing and relaxing but he gets really annoyed and psyched out and he is also very pale-skinned and so is the rest of his family so it must have been some genetic thing like twins and clones and whole bunch of other confusing science crap that I learned a long time ago in 7th grade or something which was when we watched movies in class like UHF which has weird al in it and it is very funny because weird al has to save a TV station with a whole bunch of weird shows like wheel of fish and rauls wild kingdom with a whole bunch of cool animals like flamingos and turtles and stuff like that but who cares lets get to the meaty part of this article which is the part where I write the longest word known to man which is Methionylthreonylthreonyl...isoleucine which is cut out because it has 189,819 words so wikipedia had to cut out the middle part and the longest word is the name of a protein which is the largest known to man to so big names go to big things is apparently the moral of this story ladies and gentleman the road doesn't stop here and I have to continue no matter what you say or think so I should just write some story now that has no periods so lets start with a guy named Carl who liked fish and women and he went to Clara’s house and they had a good food but that isn't enough of a story to set the record so I think I’ll just stick to writing random crap which really makes no sense at all and here is some random picture that shows a guy who has two legs and another guy who has three who is mocking the guy with two legs because he rips his flesh in disgust every night and you think about who would be dumb enough to rip their flesh instead of cut the ring off or something that doesn't involve entirely gruesome crap like that and I have another life after this one just like how cats have 9 lives I have three because I’m on my second one right now and it is great and you might think I’m a whole new person but you are thinking wrong it's just when I died I came back t life and next time I die I’ll come back to life again and then when I die I’ll be dead for sure which reminds me of Stephen king's book called pet sematary which is coo because people come back to life because there was a burial ground that bring people back to life if they are dead and that book is a great book and you should read it along with the Harry potter series which has magic in it and it is cool too so don't shank yourself when you are cutting that meat for dinner or you might die of massive blood loss or might just need a band aid I mean that works too or you don't even need a band aid because I don't use them and I have never gotten and infection in my life so maybe I’m lucky or have an alligator immune system or something but I don't use band aids and I don't use Neosporin on my cuts so I’m some sort of miracle I guess but I’m wasting twenty minutes of my miracle life on this retard article that I just want the Guinness book of world records to see and go that is the longest thing ever and have me in their book so I’m striving towards that goal right now and I’m not stopping until I hit at least 3000 words and then I’ll do the construction thing and finish thing up tomorrow or sometime after now and I will be the author of the longest single sentence on the planet earth which will be a real accomplishment on my part so you can be real jealous right now because I am making history right in front of you and if you are still reading this I am truly impressed because this article must be getting really boring by now and maybe your not even reading this just scanning the article for periods which I’m afraid you will not find until the very end of this article which is a very, very, long way away and if you are a slow reader well sucks for you but now I have to use that construction thing and I will finish this and now I am back after a hard day at work but I’m still going now so get ready to rumble with this long thing called a sentence that is as long as Mt. Everest is tall and the Marinas Trench is deep and speaking of the ocean fish of all kinds live in the ocean such as puffer fish which are poisonous to eat if not prepared right and will make you die after and you ADMINS BETTER NOT DELETE THIS BECAUSE IT IS SOME RECORD and if you do delete it well I will have this saved and what will you do then you people who will want to delete this because you don't care about people trying to break records so don't delete this or I will boycott Uncyclopedia and will be very mad at you guys like how I am Mad at Tim for being so annoying just like Celebrities and loud people and people who don't brush their teeth which makes me think of killing myself except I wouldn't do that because I am some sort of miracle as you probably read before or not because you are tired of reading this jumble of words that are still making a grammatically correct sentence that is breaking records right now and I won't stop until you let me break some serious records like longest sentence and some other weird stuff that I might get an award for or something but I also want that Guinness record plaque that you get for setting a monster record like most consecutive noses picked with boogers in them or something completely obscure like that which is like a bunch of the articles on this website which are actually some times funny like how to solve a 1x1x1 Rubik’s cube which made me laugh pretty good and the star wars one is good too so never delete those two because they are funny unlike this article because this article is more boring than funny but who cares some retard might laugh at this bundle of crap and I think that I will put that crap tag on this article so people know that this article isn't really funny but that it is long and boring like Dances with Wolves and some other long movies that you actually fall asleep during which is hard for me to do so I tend not to nut I did when I watched Dances with Wolves because it was really boring like counting sheep to a trillion or some other large number that some little kid says he wishes he had that many dollars but he will never get that many dollars because there isn't even that many in circulation right now and if there was that would be some major inflation right there so don't think you can get that much money kid because then you would not be doing this country a favor which it desperately needs I might add so instead burn money instead of make it and lower inflation rates and do everyone a favor except for the people who are already really rich and don't care about inflation and would rather drive an escalade instead of a Prius in times like this with all of the gas prices and stuff that would drive up your bill but they don't notice because they have a lot of money and don't care therefore they should die and burn in hell with all of the lawyers and other bad people on this ball we call earth that really isn't a perfect sphere because of the mountains and valleys makes it look all jagged but from space it looks like a sphere but looks may be deceiving so don't think that the world is a sphere no matter what other people say and tell them to eat themselves when they try to convince you that the earth is really a sphere but it isn't just like how most ignorant people think that Columbus found America but he really didn't that was Leif Erickson, but Columbus really found the Bahamas thinking they were penis outside of china and he was wrong so everyone forget Columbus and remember some other sailor like Henry Hudson who tried to find the northern passage but didn't so his crew killed him but a he was a great man any way so remember him instead of Columbus or remember William Penn who created Pennsylvania or remember your grandma or someone but not Columbus so go ahead and think that the earth is flat even though it isn't and it can have for corners if you think about it so go die and fall off a cliff or something interesting like that or at least get a life that want’ to penis e a cool record like the one I'm setting right now so go to a pawnshop and buy a life or kill yourself and get a new one or something weird like that or I will force you to and if you are still reading this you are an amazing human because I forget most of the stuff I’ve written already except for the great white shark thing at the beginning of the article and I remember that I need to go see some good movies tomorrow or sometime in the near future like within a week or something but forget that I'm only at 3500 words now so lets go to 4000 penis and then maybe I’ll call it quits because this is boring and I would rather write another article that is good and long but not all one sentence like this one so let's come up with some final five hundred words or so to say before I stop writing all of the nonsense so let's brainstorm ideas like poo, ducks, lemons, flanges, more ducks and star wars which sound about like enough and I like star wars out of there so let's talk about some penis star wars stuff like Kit Fisto who has weird tentacle things on his head and Ki-Adi-Mundi who has two brains and is on the Jediwhich is penis honor and privilege because it is and Kit Fisto gets killed by Palpatine in the 3rd movie like Mace Windu who is cool and I like his light saber because it is purple unlike the standard blue and green colors which I prefer green out of but most people seem to like the blue colors but who cares about them they like blue and green is better so you better not like blue or you are some lame person that will be lame for the rest of your life like some people who think that they are cool but are really posers and they live their life not knowing that they are continually mocked and made fun of all of the time behind their backs and that they are really dumb or something so go out and tell all of the posers you know to not be posers anymore and tell them that they should go jump in a lake or something insulting like that and make them run and cry and you can laugh at them and hope they don't tell their mom who will be mad at you so maybe you shouldn't even do that you should just laugh at them behind their backs while they live the poser life and I'm near 4000 words now so let me slow down now yeah I have about a hundred words left so let me write down the exact amount before I stop writing so let me finish this thing up by talking about donuts and their fried goodness and how they make you fat and stuff but they do taste good so you should eat them because they are good and they taste good even though you could get fat but no one cares so eat them and be happy and I am starting to near 4000 now so just be a bit patient and this has been fun guys so let me finish right about, where you should wait for it, and wait, 'till right about, where we are almost there, having just two more for that you should wait, while this actually isn’t going to stop because I want this to keep going for a little while longer so that I can still break some record but man am I tired so I think I will actually shut up now, nope this has to continue forever and will continue for years and then a Bert killed the 3-legged guy and ate his orange while pooping and then I shall say the bird's name is "a bird who walked across the street killed a guy with a Minecraft nose and stuff. Jesus Christ is my lord and savior.You guys probably think that that is the worlds longest sentence, but it's not,because I just keep on adding commas, and it's pretty easy, if you think about it, So anyway there is this girl at school and she's my friend, and all but she's turning really mean, its a different person, and im trying to beat the record, but that girl, who likes this boy, who likes this girl, and who likes this other boy, and that same kid likes this other girl, but that girl like another guy, but the guy is actualy a 40 year old man that eats penis for a living for the ability to never show the meerkats who's doing the write things oh and my last remark is that socialism does not work because look at Europe and Greece which is failing miserably; America always wins, there is no doubt about America's beauty, Amen.Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart—you know, if you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I'm one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s true!—but when you're a conservative Republican they try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there, went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy, and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what's going to happen and he was right—who would have thought?), but when you look at what's going on with the four prisoners—now it used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and even now, I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don't, they haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators, the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just killed, they just killed us.

678To be fair it takes an altitudinal IQ to comprehend, nein, fathom Rick and Morty. The humour is extrêmement subtile, and without a doctorate degree covering Bell inequalities, micro-lattice structures, and Schrödingerian quasi-contradictory quandaries et cetera (basically common knowledge among the top 10.3% among the world's best theoretical physicists) most of the jokes will evanesce or float away like Kantian noumena vis-a-vis Kantian phenomena, in other semantic units AKA words to plebes, as they say in some ethno-linguistic communities, but I digress: ありがとうございました. Furtherthus, to neologize a neologism henceforth, Rick’s existential-ideological naysaying, which is ITSELF located within/via Althusserian/Foucauldian poststructuralism along the subversive-critical lines of various neo-Marxist-Leninist-Maoist analyses - his tacit (cf. Polanyi) schemata appropriates affective resonances from Narodnaya Volya literature, AKA 네 엄마는 너무 뚱뚱해. The fans understand this 陰毛, as colloquially known (excepting for Gettier cases), to quote the Chinese media scholar Jean-Claude Baudrillard: "Un jugement négatif vous donne plus de satisfaction que d'éloges, à condition que cela ressemble à de la jalousie" ; they have the Intelligenz/くそ to truly (BUT WHAT IS TRUTH, cf. Sura 2:140, John 18:38) appreciate the Aristotelian-Thomistic-Hegelian synthetic a priori interpenetrative dialogic concealed within and without these tokens of jokes, to realise that they’re not just totalitarian HAHAHAs :D in a post-postmodern world of hegemonic HUHUHUs :( - light-hearted Chopin to your heavy-handed Brahms, if I may, no pun intended - they betoken something deep about Heidegerrian Dasein (cf. Mahabharata 5.39.58) through which we can, in the words of the poet William Wordsworth, 一个巫师从来没有迟到，他总是一个有力量的人 (Nǐ shìgè báich for those who aren’t fluent in Korean). m_nkind (note: "Mankind" is a sexist term, see Judith Butler's Gender Trouble published by Routledge, London:London March 1990) or should I say, specimens of m_nkind who manifest disaffection (i.e. βοηθήστε με, παρακαλώ να με βοηθήσει κανείς) contingent upon “their” finite liminal qualia vis-a-vis Rick &amp; Morty’s transcendental apperception via meme-ification truly (but again, WHAT IS TRUTH? お前はもう死んでいる) ARE idiotos (masculine of idiota in German, contra p_triarchal discourse)- of course, necessarily they wouldn’t appreciate vis-a-vis their unity-of-consciousnesses, for instance, the linguistico-Bayesian formal articulation in Rick’s slogan existentiel “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a Derridian poly/hypertextual para-dactyllic reference to Turgenev’s Lacanian epic отцы и изюм (reminiscent of Turgenev's earlier вы используете переводчика, не так ли, сука?) I’m smirking right now in several languages just envisioning in my corpus callosoom one of those cisgendered, capitalist-fascist, hyper-Puritanical, anti-anti-anti-omnicorporatistic biguts scratching their 陰茎 (EXCUSE MY FRENCH) in anti-jouissance as polyglot, Renaissance Zen m_n Dan Harmon’s Minervian owl unfolds itself (Note: あなたは実際にこれを翻訳していたのですか？あなたはあなたの時間を無駄にしています ) at the break of dawn/don/DUNE (semantic balderdash!) on their Lovecraftian-boob-tubes, to subtly reference the semantic units of the Scottish philosopher David Hume who would also say: “あなたのママはとても太っている.” What 아 름 다 운 영 혼 을 가 진 바 보 들 .. je suis tout seul.




EDIT: [Original version w/ sweet HYPERLINKS](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/78cpiu/rick_and_morty_copypasta_but_on_steroids/dotizil/)I wish I could give this thing zero stars. You don't see the fish's dick. Not once. How is such a thing possible? Let's make 'Jurassic Park' but not show the dinosaurs. Let's make 'Aliens' but with no Xenomorphs. How about 'Titanic' with zero boat. This is a movie about a lady having sex with a fish (who has a fish penis) and the fact that you never get to lay eyes upon his aquatic member is an embarassment to everyone involved. Would love to say, "I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed," but I'm definitely both. Best picture my ass, anyone who says they liked this pile needs to take a look in the mirror and tell themselves they deserve better than a movie about a woman who has sex with a fish where you never see the fish's dick. Not once.That's all it takes to make you laugh? Such a pedestrian sense of humor. I laugh at how pathetic and infantile your intellect is that such a childish image can entertain you to the point of laughter.

*Edit:* you snowflakes are so sensitive. Why don't you go back to your safe spaces? Also, stop downclobbering me, I don't like it and it's ruining my excellent karma score.
  
**Edit 2: stop downclubbing me this instant, you Neanderthalian degenerates.**You don't need friends to make A's. Case in point, I have no friends and make A's. "Social life" is a waste of time. All the lonely kids here who complain about trouble making friends are being spoiled brats who think having friends is a necessity, and they should be happy with just making good grades. Socializing is not a necessity, unlike food and water.

Unlike you lesser apes. I have evolved beyond primitive desires for companionship. I am a completely rational, asexual human being an intellectual.

&amp;#x200B;Pfft! You're ONLY a vegan? What a fucking hypocrite, you know plants are alive too. Oppression doesn't cease to be evil just because the oppressed aren't sentient organisms. How about trying to live off of absorbing the raw elements required for life directly through your cell membrane like our great ancestors, the amoebas, did. Why do you eat plants, I bet it's cause they don't guilt you with their screams but that doesn't mean they aren't in pain. You think you care about life, get on my level sweetie!I lost my bestfriend to a hater dabbing back, as he was dying in my arms I tried to get answers, I tried to ask Jake Paul for help...but no answer. I watched my friend die as he kept asking "What do I do if the haters dab back?", and all I could do was nothing. If only Jake had answered my bestfriend would still be here today :'(Basically like in this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EEQgq0HM_kHonestly, the whole copypasta thing is starting to really get annoying. We get it, you're unoriginal. The sooner you get over it, the sooner we can all come closer as a community. They're not even that funny, tbh.What's this you've said to me, my good friend? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in conflict resolution, and I've been involved in numerous friendly discussions, and I have over 300 confirmed friends. I am trained in polite discussions and I'm the top mediator in the entire neighbourhood. You are worth more to me than just another target. I hope we will come to have a friendship never before seen on this Earth. Don't you think you might be hurting someone's feelings saying that over the internet? Think about it, my friend. As we speak I am contacting my good friends across the USA and your P.O. box is being traced right now so you better prepare for the greeting cards, friend. The greeting cards that help you with your hate. You should look forward to it, friend. I can be anywhere, anytime for you, and I can calm you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my chess set. Not only am I extensively trained in conflict resolution, but I have access to the entire group of my friends and I will use them to their full extent to start our new friendship. If only you could have known what kindness and love your little comment was about to bring you, maybe you would have reached out sooner. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now we get to start a new friendship, you unique person. I will give you gifts and you might have a hard time keeping up. You're finally living, friend.Shut yo skin tone chicken bone google chrome no home flip phone disowned ice cream cone garden gnome extra chromosome metronome dimmadome genome full blown monochrome student loan indiana jones overgrown flintstone x and y hormone friend zoned sylvester stallone sierra leone autozone professionally seen silver patrone head ass tf upoh, really? she's single handedly changing the face of gaming from an excludatory haven for misogyny plagued with toxic masculinity to a culture where everyone is welcome and women aren't harassed or alienated. sorry you can't have your boys club anymore, but care to explain how she copy pasted all of that? give me a break. 

she has achieved more in the past few years than you'll probably do in your life. I only say that because only a very small, petty type of person would have such a dismissive and toxic attitude regarding social progress and change. this is coming from a male feminist who once was a redpiller and thought women were objects and not people. feminism - read about it sometime.

http://np.reddit.com/r/CringeAnarchy/comments/3pe4xg/anita_sarkeesian_rebrands_herself_by_ripping_off/cw5l0is?context=2A reading of the Navy Seal Copypasta, but every swear word is replaced with We are number one, and every "One" is replaced with the nutshack theme, where every "Nutshack" is replaced with Brendaniel's reading of the Bee movie script, and every bee pun is replaced with a random episode of the simpsons (Use a RNG or something, I'd also be best if it was only the early seasons) And every time there is a character catchphrase (Homer Saying "D'oh, Bart saying "Eat My Shorts" or some shit, you get it) it's replaced with a random episode of Yiay (Again, use a RNG) and every time there is a Light Switch or Forehead joke, It's replaced with Robbie stepping on a branch. I'll keep posting it until it becomes a thing.﻿One fateful day while I was tugging away, I happened upon a Teletubby video and...I...just...lost it. I had never felt so alive in my life. My hand just goes into overdrive. I'm pounding this thing-I actually don't know how I didn't get irritated foreskin from the amount of friction-and I just feel my body reaching new heights of ecstasy. I'm looking Po's thick self and imagining her straddling my face. I mean who wouldn't; she's perfection. 6'5". Brown Eyes. And a natural ass that puts all the Ms. Botoxs in the Hills to shame. So anyway I'm exhilarated. I actually can't even remember the moment I cum but a little hit the ceiling. And from that point I was hooked. 4 sometimes 5 times a day I started jacking it to Teletubby videos. But now every time I see anything somewhat related to Teletubbies I get uncontrollably hard. Teletubby toy? Erect. Wind Turbine? Erect. Pink Slime? I damn near pop right there and then: my biggest fantasy is Po rubbing that pink slime stuff on both of us so we can have intense, wet sex and practically revert to two retarded llamas attempting to procreate in a pile of mud. I haven't told anyone about this fetish and hope to break it soon but I haven't felt this alive while pleasing myself in a long time.ｗｅｌｌ ｓｉｍｐｌｅｔｏｎ. ｉｆ ｙｏｕ ｗｉｌｌ ｎｏｔ ｕｐｖｏｔｅ ｍｙ 审美 ｒｉｇｈｔ ｔｈｅ 他妈的 ｎｏｗ, ｙｏｕ ｗｉｌｌ ｓｕｆｆｅｒ ｍｙｅｔｅｒｎａｌ ａｎｇｅｒ.

Many of you ignored this rule and from this point onward, any copypasta about Cummybot will result in a perma-ban.[removed]I've got aspergers. For people like me, fidget cubes, spinners, etc. are VERY helpful to us when we're stimming. When I heard about the fidget spinner, I was pretty excited. A silent, subtle fidget toy that doesn't make you look like an ass? Sign me up!
Queue people who turn it into a trend. Now I can't get one without looking like a moron. Now people are spinning it on their heads, putting razor blades on it, etc.
Reasonably, teachers and similar people are now taking them away.
It pisses me off. I don't give a shit if a neurotypical uses them, it's not my job to police people- but I was under the impression that they were supposed to help people be less autistic, not help people be more autistic.丂口从乇乃口刀丫 口𠘨匚乇 丅口乚刀 从乇 丅卄乇 山口尺乚刀 工丂 厶口𠘨𠘨卂 尺口乚乚 从乇

I didn't want other pasta, I wanted the conchiglie pasta. It might have been the name (conchiglie pasta), or it might have been the shell-like shape. All I know is that I like conchiglie pasta.
You can have mini conchiglie pasta called conchigilette. It is still conchigile, so I like it.
So when people ask what pasta is the best variety of pasta, it is hands down conchiglie pasta. There is no competition on this front. Conchiglie pasta.[removed]I just fucking love Rick and Morty, in the way that I fucking love science. It's so random and cool - it's like the show was designed for us Redditors, see? My mom says I have an unhealthy obsession with the show, but she just doesn't understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everything would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty are so funny and I'm so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it'd be even better if Bernie Sanders appeared. It'd be so awesome I'd turn up the TV in the common room of my dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.

I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We don't talk to each other but there's a cute girl there I'm gonna try and ask out. I'm a nice guy and I dress well (fedora + trench coat + brown-stained underwear + well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I've got a good chance with her. I've already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven't got a response yet.

Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked him "When does the narwhal bacon?", he'd know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if you squint a bit and use your imagination? This can't be a coincidence; MLG Illuminati confirmed. Yeah, that's right, I look at montage parodies too. What good Redditor doesn't? Lenny face, Illuminati, and Doge are so funny. If I met Rick and Morty I'd be sure to show them all those funny and awesome memes and more!

Yours baconly, Atheist92When you type, "Hey..." and it autocorrects to:

"SPONGEBOB, ME LAD, YOU HAVE TOO MANY ORIFICES FER YER OWN GOOD. YER GETTIN' A PROMOTION!" said Mr. Krabs as his hard red carapaced cock jabbed into the back of Spongebob's head.

"I feel like I'm absorbing some weird fluid," spluttered Spongebob as Krabs' nasty crustaceo-jizz poured from his mouth, nose and eyes.

"NOW EARN YOUR KEEP, LANDLUBBER," said Krabs as he grabbed Spongebob by his jizz-soaked trousers and began using him to clean the floor.

"Oh Mr. Krabs, I-"

"CALL ME MASTER YE BITCH"

Krabs stepped down hard in Spongebob and a puddle of his own jizz began spreading radially on the floor of the Krusty Krab.

"Hurgghbglbgblblgbl."

"CHOKE ON IT, YE INVERTEBRATE, OR I CAN'T GET HARRRRRRD. THESE CLAWS AREN'T JUST GOOD FER MATIN…OH, WAIT, YES THEY ARE," said Krabs as he caressed his eleventh leg.

The jizz began floating up toward the ceiling as Krabs brandished his seven-inch red masthead. You have to realize this is to scale, so it was about twice his body size.

Anyway, Squidward burst into the room wearing only a gimp suit and a tutu.

"TAKE ME MASTER, I NEED TO BE HUMILIATED," he said, as his four-millimeter calamari poked limply from the tight leather.

"TAKE THIS, THEN," said Krabs as he jabbed one of his prehensile eyestalks up Squidward's stankhole. Squidward moaned, rubbing himself gently with 5 of his tentacles.

"I CAN SEE YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR HOLE VERY OFTEN," said Krabs. Patrick burst into the room wearing nothing but a smile and brandishing a towel. "DID SOMEBODY CALL THE HOLE DOCTOR?"

"Are you a real doctor?" asked Spoogebob.

"I went to community college," said Patrick as he forcibly yanked out Krabs' eyestalk and shoved it in his gay fat mouth.

"Hold this open, will ya?" said Patrick as he ripped off Spongebob's erect penis and used it to jam Squidward's hole open. It immediately grew back but smaller and wetter.

"Hmm... there's a lot of SHIT in here," said Patrick. "How much fiber is in Krabby Patties anyway?"

"YE WOULDN'T BELIEVE," said Krabs, as a gigantic turd stretched his red asshole until it tore.

"I NEED AN ENEMA," said Patrick. "OH WAIT WE'RE UNDERWATER." Patrick nibbled gently at the tip of Krabs' eyestalk as he released it from his mouth. He wiped eye fluid from the corner of his mouth and put Squidward's zippered lips to his own.

"ON THE COUNT OF THREE" said Patrick. "ONE… TWO… OH FUCK IT HNRRRRRRGGUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!"

Patrick blew Squidward like a trumpet. All 8 of his tentacles went rigid and his squidjuice spilled out from the dick hole in his suit. The immense force started to blow crusty chunks of shit out of Squidward's ass.

"I must keep the Krusty Krab clean!" yelled Spoogebob as he rushed over and opened his mouth. Spongebob recognized bits of the Krabby Patty formula in his mouth as Squidward's acrid shit coated his tongue and teeth.

"SWALLOW, YE LANDLUBBER," said Krabs, poking his dick at Spongebob's lips.

"HMRGGRGHRGUHF," said Spongebob, shaking his head. He wanted to savor it, but Krabs had other plans.

Krabs got up on his desk and flexed. "GET READY" he yelled as he jumped down on Spongebob with a stone cold stunner. Blood, semen and shit sprayed powerfully from every one of Spongebob's holes. The force of the explosion tore both of his legs off. The assorted fluids and solids coated the walls of Krabs' office.

"YE GOT THAT SHIT ALL OVER ME FIRST DOLLAR," screeched Krabs. "AND YOU KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO CLEAN IT!"

Squidward, Patrick and Spongebob all begged at Krabs' knees, pleading to be the ones who got to lick the moist brown dollar. "THE FIRST ONES WHO CAN FIND SANDY AND SUCK OFF HER FUTA COCK GET TO LICK THE DOLLAR," decreed Krabs, stowing the dollar in his ass for safekeeping.

The three homos scrambled out of the room and towards the treedome.

**ONE HOUR LATER**

Spongebob, Patrick and Squidward approached the door of Sandy's tree house, not so much as an undergarment between them, and knocked politely on the door.

Sandy didn't respond, so Patrick broke down the door with his erect, barrel-like member.

"SANDY," they screamed, not caring about the lack of water. "SAAAAAANDY!"

Patrick picked up some mud and smeared it on his face. "I'M DIRTY DAN," he growled.

"I hope Dirty Dan likes getting RAMMED UP THE ASS," yelled Spongebob, as he thrust his supple yellow cattle prod into Patrick's chasmal pink rear. Patrick groaned in pleasure.

"Who you callin' pinhead?"

"SHUT THE FUCK UP! DIRTY DAN DOESN'T TALK," screamed Spongebob as he climaxed.

Patrick scooped out some of Spongebob's cum from his cavernous brown crevice and smeared it into Squidward's eyes. "YOU'RE DIRTY DAN!"

"UNGHHHH, IT HURTS SO GOOD!" Squidward smeared the semen into his eyes until they bled. Blood and semen gushed down his face.

"THIS REMINDS ME OF THAILAND," said Spongebob pensively, puffing on his pipe, which he fashioned out of one of his older penises.

Squidward enjoyed what remained of Spongebob's cum as Spongebob rode the tip of Patrick's voluminous horsehitch into Sandy's room. She was sleeping, but she looked like she had put on weight. Her futa cock was fully erect.

"LET'S RAPE HER," suggested Patrick, peeling Spongebob off his penis and throwing him violently against the wall.
"Wait Patrick, don't you know ANYTHING about squirrels?" cautioned Spongebob, ripping off his damaged member and growing a new one. He placed the damaged one on a necklace he was keeping.

"I KNOW THEY'RE EXCELLENT TARGETS FOR RAPE, ESPECIALLY WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING," said Patrick as he jammed his holiday yule log into Sandy's ear. She was fast asleep and didn't seem to notice, but her cock twitched.

"It's called HIBERNATION, Patrick. Squirrels stuff valuable treasures into their vaginas and then go to sleep for six months."

"TREASURE? I WANT TREASURE" roared Patrick as he dove head-first into Sandy's gaping pussy. "UHH, I'M STUCK. WHERE'S THE TREASURE?"

"GO...DEEPER!" grunted Spongebob, giving Patrick a good shove.

"I CAN'T. I'M TOO FAT," he replied. "I'M REALLY HORNY THOUGH."

Spongebob chuckled. His plan had worked. Patrick was incapacitated and he was free to suck off Sandy's futa cock while she slept.

"SPONGEBOB? SPONGEBOB, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?" Patrick's muffled voice rang out from somewhere nearby, but Spongebob was enjoying Sandy's hard, flexible prick in his mouth.

Sandy rolled over and her dick went through the side of Spongebob's mouth and out one of his ear holes. "COME ON, DAMMIT, WHY WON'T YOU CUM?" muttered Spongebob as he moved himself sensually up and down the length of Sandy's anaconda.

At last, the sleeping squirrel climaxed, shooting hot greasy cum from Spongebob's ear. He pocketed some of it because he knew Krabs would require proof, probably while raping him violently.

"MMMRH? WHO SUCKED ME OFF?" murred Sandy as she rubbed her eyes.

"SPONGEBOB, YOU CHEATER!" yelled Patrick, his voice muffled by the squirrel's vaginal wall.

Spongebob ran as fast as his gay little legs would carry him out of Sandy's room. Squidward was attempting to fuck a tree.i was in my junior year, and i had the biggest fantasy towards insects, particularly those that would fly. i saw a post on instagram about how freezing bees puts them to sleep, and then they wake up with heat, so i decided to put it to the test. i left a mixture of sugar and water on my window sill while i went to sleep, and the next morning the container was filled with bees, flies, the whole lot. i scraped out as many as i could, then threw them in the freezer before i got dressed for school. by the time i got home, they were all rock hard pellets, all lying still. i took the container to my room, and couldn't help myself. i a shoved the frozen creatures inside me, moaning as they came alive. i felt my pussy get stung by a bee, but honestly was the best ive ever felt. this only caused my kink to grow. i repeated the same the other day, this time with only flies. long story short, maggots have been crawling out my pussy for days now and idk if i should be worried or aroused. If I ever see another Redditor comment "fake and gay" on my post again, with the help of 4chan, I will find where you live, drive there, and personally stick my dick in your ass.

The beautiful effort put into writing this comment is really expressed through the extremely subtle message that is hidden deep within it. After reading your comment, I immediately resigned from being a hater, and can proudly say I joined the logang. I can't imagine the effort and countless hours you poured into that comment, and I must thank you for it, it has completely changed who I am as a person. I think you need to show your exquisite writing to Harvard because you could get a fully paid English scholarship with the Divine skill that you posses. I wish you luck with your wondrous career in English writing, and I hope to read multiple novels in the future written by none other than the person who turned my life around, karina ivonne riojas infante. Such a stupendous name as well m'lady. Well *tips fedora* thanks, and thanks again for helping me join the logang. #logangforlife﻿I was at the movie theater the other day, to see Incredibles 2. The SECOND that Elastigirl came on screen I couldn't help it- she was so thicc. I imagined her stretching out her clit to peg me. I HAD to jack off. When I did, I realized that if i didn't act quickly my pants would be filled with my splooge. I had to whip out my dick and give the person in front of me a salty surprise. When he turned around he didn't understand what was happening, but when he touched his head and saw my penis pudding on his hand, he started throwing a fit. A small child behind me starting crying, and the mom went somewhere. Turns out where she was going was to snitch on me! I got kicked out, for giving a man what any well-rounded, culture-appreciating human would've loved. He was a cock-juggling, dick-slurping, ass-licking, sausage-massaging, shit-eating, skunk-fucking, thunder-cunt, worthless boil on the ass of humanity. If he didn't want my cock chowder on him, he shouldn't have sat in front of a known, world-famous, registered sex offender.

Think again, maggot. The furry fandom is a breeding ground for the most advanced autism this planet has ever seen. Every day, thousands are consumed by a tidal wave of OwO and cancerous roleplaying, and the foundations of our society slowly weaken under the constant onslaught of weapons-grade cringe. Our founding fathers recoil in disgust as people dress up as animals and buy giant dildos on the Internet, fucking each other in sweaty drunken homosexual orgies and traumatizing children in droves. Every second we draw closer to Furry Armageddon, and you sit there saying stupid shit on the Internet. To compare someone to a furry is the most heinous insult imaginable. When your door gets broken down by a rainbow wolf/deer hybrid and you get yiffed into oblivion, then we'll see who's laughing. This is a real threat and it must be treated with extreme solemnity.are there people who actually thinking sucking dick is gay?

you're sharing protein

you're admiring masculine physique

being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

all these summer DYEL's piss me off. their twink bodies don't understand, but in time i'm sure they'll get it.Cool racism bro makes you seem like a big man on the fucking internet. Literally say that to my face, I fucking dare you, say this kinda shit in front of me and I’ll rip your fucking face off with my paw so damn fast your brain wouldn’t even have time to recognize it. I’ll gladly enjoy the red spray squirting from your frontal lobe on my fursuit and drenched in your dying blood. I wouldn’t even need to bath with it on because your’s wouldn’t be he first blood that’s coated my hide, and I take pride in showing what happens when someone disrespects me or someone in my pack. What if KFC stood for Kilos of Fuckin Cum and instead of a big bucket of chicken they just gave you a bucket full of cum and you had to put a giant lid on it like a drink so it doesn’t slosh around and spill in your carWhen I was 13 and in the throes of that which vexes all boys of the age (the inability to see anything vaguely boob shaped without immediately hardening up and having to run to the nearest portajohn to rub one out) I had a very attractive older sister. She was 4 years older than me, and had an early birthday so she was one of the oldest in her grade but still relatively close to me in grades since I had a late birthday. Anyway, we had a good relationship, like I was the typical annoying younger brother and she was the hot older sister who would prance around in a bra and panties and "accidently" leave the door open in the bathroom while showering and changing and I would be left longing and drooling and diving into her hamper to bath in her dirty underwear and she knew how I felt because she would wink and laugh and joke around and it was all very non-serious so it wasn't really fucked up. Well, she worked at a popular fast food restaurant (name withheld because they're region specific) in the kitchen, doing beautiful things with cooking oil and greasy meat. I still to this day remember her radiance when she'd come home reeking of sweat and grease and tear off her uniform in the living room while jumping in joy at her shift being over, her teenaged boobs bouncing joyfully while I shift a throw pillow over my crotch to shield my 4-inch boner.

One day, I got a phone call from my mom that my sister had been hurt at work and she was in the hospital. She had been pretty badly burnt on her forearms and hands at work, and would be at home for a few weeks to recover, since she was all taped up like a mummy from the elbows down. So I became my sister's helper in a way. I would get stuff for her, keep her entertained, scratch her itches, all the normal stuff. After two days, she turned to me with tears in her eyes:

"I really have to shit but I can't wipe myself... I just can't get a grip on the paper... can you do it for me? Be the best brother ever?"

My eyes glazed over and I'm sure my jaw slackened a bit.

"I... uh... yeah, that's pretty gross, I guess, but I'd do it for you."

She grinned and stood up.

"I knew you would do it. Now help me get my pants off."

There was no hiding my gigantic boner. It was the most intimate thing I've ever experienced in my entire life. I unbuttoned her jeans and tugged them down, exposing a blue lacy thong that hugged the contours of her voluptuous ass. She walked over to the toilet.

"Now the thong please. Oh thanks you are the best brother ever!"

Now, if she noticed my hand lingering a little longer than it needed to over her soft pubic mount, she didn't say anything, and i noticed her breathing speed up as well. She sat down.

Her bowel movement can only be described as the sound of angel's trumpets announcing glorious news. The timbre of her resonating asshole, the stench of her earthy waste, the splatter and the thumps, all come together in a majestic cacophony of ecstasy. At this point, I had my hand in my pants and I was inhaling deeply, gasping at the air like a drowning man. I wanted her essence inside of me.

The moment lasted forever and it lasted 30 seconds. I was so excited that what happened next is only recalled in a series of flashbacks. My hand, clutching a wad of pearly white paper, slowly and intimately massaging her asshole. Getting up close for observation. Maximum cleanliness. The glory of love, desire, passion, and need. Gentle strokes from pussy to ass. Hair as fine and beautiful as silk. The eradication of earthen brown from her salmon colored asshole. Incalculable pleasure.

And just as quickly as it happened, it was over. She giggled, had me pull her clothes up, and led me, gauze-wrapped hand in mine ignoring the pain, back into the living room, where we turned on "Family Matters" and laughed at Urkel's shenanigans.The human penis is certainly among the finest in the animal kingdom. It is generally of robust, satisfying proportion, features subtle ribbing that provides sturdiness and enhanced sensation, has smooth, sliding skin which reduces friction and provides excellent mouthfeel, and is visually interesting with its many veins, skin folds, and a glans with a shape that suggests sleekness and a color that changes to demonstrate the intensity of lust.

However, it is certainly not &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; best. It is firmly in third place.

In first obviously comes the horse. I won't go into great detail on horse cocks, as they are already quite popular even with the non-zoophilic general public. The size, the shape, and the power of the animal a horse cock is attached to are all part of a sexual mystique that has been well explored in many cultures throughout history.

There is one other kind of animal, however, that has us solidly beat, even though it has no such following. I speak of the spectacular, over-the-top sensuality of the amazing "red rocket" possessed by canines. We ignore this one, perhaps, because dogs are generally much closer to the majority of us than horses. There is no reason to romanticize the mundane, as we do for the equine penis, and we are often quite scared of our dogs' sexuality, since we do have to live with them instead of just looking at them in a field we're driving by. By acknowledging that it's at all there, we are forced to deal with it in a fashion other than having the vet remove it, and we are usually more worried about what that means for us than what it means for them.

Nonetheless, dog penises are wonderful, a fact which deserves to be recognized even if the vast majority of us will never experience one firsthand.

The first thing that anyone will notice about a dog's erection is the color. "Florid" is the best word I can think of to describe this beautiful display. From angry, fire engine red, through every possible shade of pink, with some extraordinary specimens additionally featuring deep purple and glistening white, an erect dog's penis rewards the viewer's eyes with the full spectrum of colors that our culture associates with the urgent desire of lust. As it comes out of its sheath, its palette seems to beg to return to a warm and cozy place inside the body of another.

Its form and functionality are similarly titillating. The pointed, very slightly flared tip allows for easy entry without being completely smooth, and while perhaps not as visually exciting as the glans of a human, certainly gets the job done comfortably and efficiently. The size when fully erect tends to be very impressive in proportion to its owner, often being much thicker and somewhat longer than the average human penis. However, most people aren't fully aware of that, because of another handy trick the canine dick can perform.

When the action begins, it's much smaller. Very thin, and a bit shorter. Once it's in, or played with sufficiently, it inflates to its full, throbbing size, allowing for the receptive partner to adjust more comfortably. No inflatable dildo I've ever seen has such a wide range of widths as does our best friends' tackle. They usually just seem to start at "too big" and get "slightly bigger." A dog's penis is much more friendly, allowing even the novice to enjoyably accommodate something really fat and juicy.

And juicy it certainly is! One of the best things about wolf wang is the precum. There is so much! And unlike ours, which merely drools when we get close to the end, theirs begins squirting almost constantly, nearly as soon as the fun begins. The result is a satisfyingly messy taste sensation that is truly without compare. On the other end, this also serves a practical purpose, contributing greatly to the fact that a dog penis is self-lubricating, a trait I'm sure we've all wished we could share at some point.

Of course, no discussion of dog dicks would be complete without a mention of the crown jewel, the one thing that most strikingly sets them apart from us: the bulbus glandis. Ranging in size from a rather small plum to near that of a softball, the swollen base of a canine's cock is both an invitation and a challenge. Do you want to take the knot? Can you? Once you have, of course, there is the dizzying feeling of being dominated, not by your partner, but by your own desires. Trapped there on the floor for up to twenty minutes, one must simply wait and enjoy the feeling of being so consumed with lustful passion that the fear and shame of being caught seem immaterial. When you are tied, it is inescapable that a part of your identity is firmly outside of the mainstream's comfort zone. A piece of your soul is there, wrapped tightly around that dog's twitching, squirting dick just as surely as your pussy or ass is.

The thing that draws many to such interests is the fact that this is a perfectly symbolic microcosm for all of our sexuality. In our culture, even purely vanilla sex is often made to feel "naughty." The most banal and benign aspects of sexuality are couched in terms that make us feel a little wrong to want it, even in the strictly defined contexts where it's not supposed to be. In that moment when you accept the knot, and make yourself incapable of defense against whatever might occur should your door suddenly open, you have decided that you're not going to play that game anymore. The world may say you're a filthy slut; you're happy to be one, if that means enjoying yourself to the fullest with your most loyal companion.

Overall, it is simply a fact that your dog's dick is better than yours in nearly every way that matters. It's alright to feel a little jealous, but I think it would be nice if we as a culture could recognize this more openly, similarly to how we do for horses. Happiness in this strange and beautiful world in which we live lies in fully appreciating all of nature's marvels, and nature has certainly made the canine penis marvelous.If my Bitcoin💲💰 and my girl😍👰 both drowning😱🌊 and I could only save one😤😬 Catch me HODL'ing at my girls funeral😔👻🌹 Cuz its To The Moon or Nothing, kiddo 💰💯🔥😎📈💲Hey guys at school today i epic-style double-dabbed on ANOTHER one of my libercuck teachers in school. This time we were talking about my grades and how i needed "disiplenary action" or something like that from the last time i Nae-naed my teacher, and just as she was about to finish her SJW sentence I screamed "Trump IS our president, whether you like it or not, and crying won't solve your problems snowflake!". Then I did that epic libertard-own face that milo always does and everyone clapped! Take THAT, librariantards!!!That's a whole debate waiting to happen, really. Some pokemon are probably intelligent enough for that (mostly psychic types) and some of them might not be. There's also a whole argument based on the fact that you are the pokemon's master and therefore may be abusing a position of power over them.

Though at the end of the day the world of pokemon is a wild west if you really stop to think about it, lots of hormone-addled trainers venturing off into the wilderness where no one is sure to come by, making completely secret little hidden bases for god-knows-what purpose, so if you really wanted to then no one other than the pokemon itself could stop you or would even know it happened.

So the takeaway is that only you can answer that question for yourself, as everyone's gonna have their own opinion. My vote is "it's probably fine"What if I jerked off and didn't think about nothing or look at porn, but just stared at a can of beans
If I jerked off to beans consistently enough could I train myself to be sexually attracted to beans?
I think I will perform this experimentEvery day I wake up to my phone whose alarm is the theme song of Jojo's Bizzare Adventure, I walk to my bathroom and with every step, I hear another Jojo reference, I try to live a normal life *saying I'm deaf* but I lie, I can hear everything but everything is a Jojo reference, I tried to masturbate but with every stroke when my hand comes in contact with the base of my dick I don't hear a simple clap intead I hear a Jojo reference I tried to commit suicide but when I pulled the trigger insted of a bang I heard a Jojo refrence... I live in a constant state of agony. hey im lorrieater the epic creator of .......... nothing.

now  look at the first letter of the paragraph above and it spells a word and its what i am good luck xD.Guys, I'm shaking. I'm fucking shaking.

I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Yuri. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring.

I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Yuri pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Dan Salvato create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!

Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.Now that a girl likes me, can you guess what I'm looking forward to?💞💖💕💓💗❤

I'll give you a hint😏

It starts with the letter 'M' and ends in 'arriage' 😍

My President Donald Trump has far more firepower at his disposal than he realizes. I am a proud member of a local militia here in the blue state of Massachusetts. We are 40 strong, with 12 ex-military and 1 ex-navy seal. ( 7 with combat experience, the seal has extensive combat experience and is our leader and teacher )
We formed almost 5 years ago and we practice every week for 16 hours on the weekends. We are properly equipped and are highly trained, and 100% loyal to President Trump. There is an entire network of like minded groups in the northeast that have had detailed and consistent communication and plans regarding any situation that threatens the country - foreign or domestic.
We may be citizen soldiers but the SEAL has turned us into true warriors. When we first started many of us were out of shape and lethargic. Many were gamers in poor health. Three are mothers concerned about the future of their kids and country. Our military members taught us how to eat right, work out properly, think on our toes, and have trained us in numerous weapon systems, tactics, first aid, etc. Trained in every season the northeast gives us. They also are in constant contact with their military buddies and President Trump has nearly universal support. They covertly tell them that if forced to choose, they would back President Trump with any force required.
If the liberals try to do anything, we will be ready. All of us will. I think people will be VERY shocked at what comes out of the backwoods in our more rural counties in this country. The gun ranges are placed there for a reason after all. :-)
Our patriot group is within 15 min of 5 substations, and 3 national guard armories. We know which police departments are against us, for us, or on the fence. 
The left and many people make the incorrect assumption that militias are made up of "hicks" and are unprofessional. They will be in for quite a shock if they try to steal the office.
Everyone here is on our highest alert we have that is in peacetime. We thought Hillary was going to steal the election and we were all geared up and ready to go. But Trump won rightfully so and we stood down. We now fear that they will fabricate bullshit to try to force a new election.
Listen carefully, Democrats. If you try this, it will be the biggest mistake you have ever made. We are DEAD serious about obeying the founding fathers commands to take up arms and purge a corrupt government. Let it go. Focus on 4 years from now.
If you push this, what happens will be completely on your hands. You reap what you sow.CHECK THE COMMENTS Hows it goin?


The names, Foster... 💀

Im a Demon, Sent from the wastlands of the Glowing Sea, where we were cast out, and through disaster and devostation, we lost our innocense. It is in that moment, that feeling, the feeling of powerlessness. It is in that feeling where good men, turn cruel. I on the other hand, know this feeling, and will do everything in my power, to make sure no man must bere that feeling, alone.


So step up, if you want to get burn't 🔥

He isn't doing anything wrong, the whole point of copypasta is to copy and paste it places. Next time you see him, give him a compliment. He is not a bot as some people are saying, he is a good friend of everyone. Have a good day.OFFICIAL OVERWATCH PUSSY TIER LIST

S-Tier
&gt;D.Va
Being young and Korean has its perks. D.Va is easily the tightest member of the Overwatch cast, and keeps her pubes trimmed to a sparse length (gaming all day, doesn't have time to shave). D.Va's pussy is small and eager, ready to be taught in the ways of pleasure.
Notable characteristics- Small labia, tight, trimmed pubes

A-Tier
&gt;Mercy
Overwatch's one true MILF shines in the pussy department. She has had no children, and being the pure angel of the game she hasn't been penetrated often. Her little clit loves attention and she keeps a pristinely shaved/trimmed triangle of white-blonde pubes above her womanhood. Notable characteristics- Light pink coloration, pattern pubes, small clit.

&gt;Mei
A chubby frame holds a warm, bountiful vagina. There is no better fuck on a winter's night, as Mei's pussy envelopes cock eagerly and pleasures it in a cradle of warm wetness. Due to her scientific labors, she rarely has time to shave her vagina resulting in abundant pubic hair. This arguably creates more warmth during those long nights, however. Mei's vagina has chubby lips and a distinct pink coloration. Notable characteristics- pubes, larger clit, warm and abundant wetness, cute puffy lips.

B-Tier

&gt;Widowmaker
A pair of light blue lips squeeze her labia tightly. Widow's exotic French pussy is experienced and capable. Widowmaker's taste is akin to blueberries. She is very sensitive to oral stimulation, and prefers penetration only after long foreplay. Notable qualities- good taste, purple coloration, tight appearance.
Mei best girl.You'd actually have to have a high IQ and be emotional strong to have a body pillow, because not only does it require a high IQ to bring a body pillow a live in your imagination, it also requires a lot of mental and psychological stamina to maintain a happy body pillow since they do require a lot of work to have around and especially if you are storing them in the bed. Furthermore, people who are attached to bodypillows have a high tendency to be multilingual and know complex words like kawaii, watashi and sugoi, which definitely shouldn't be underestimated because their meanings are very subtle so they require an immense amount of intelligence to fully understand and an even higher IQ to use in the everyday life. With this said it is only logical to pay a lot of respect and admire those who keep bodypillows in their room of their mom's basement, everything else would be undeniable irrational and absolutely moronic.

People say to me that a person being Johny is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but to that I say, "no papa". I'm having a plastic surgeon shrink me down to the size of a baby, severely elongate my arms and make my head the size of a fucking beach ball.  From now on I want you guys to always follow my name with "doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and respect my right to If you can't accept me you're a Johnyphobe and need to check your papa privilege.

(Nazi Sirens)Just shut the fuck up. This copypasta was never even funny to begin with. I've never even seen the show, and it was obviously a joke. What kind of idiot do you have to be to think that was ever said seriously? But it makes fun of something which is popular, and therefore popular to shit on among the contrarians on Reddit. 

Come on, really. I actually do have to wonder about the IQs of people who like that pretentious copypasta. You know, I sometimes can't help but superiorly smirk as I imagine their dumb faces struggling to understand words on a mere internet webpage. In fact, I sometimes find myself in paroxysms of ironic Schadenfreude as I envision the visages of the aforementioned Slow-in-the-minds waging war with the Cultural Artifact they proclaim to be analyzing, only to fall, slack-jawed, back into their insensate stupor, the proverbial Undiscovered Country, "from whose bourn no traveler returns" .  I'm cummybot and I drink so much com that I am now a world champion bodybuilder.  I am so retarded that, like an autistic boy, repeats what everyone says.  I'm going to kill myself now...iDubbbzTV is my favorite LGBT YouTuber, and is a true activist for LGBTQ+ rights in America. Our racist, homophobic, white-supremacist, republican, judaphobic, xenophobic president, known as "Donald J. Drumpf" thinks he can kill all LGBT people, but not when we have amazing activists like iDubbbz standing up for LGBT community members! Just his bravery is amazing, the way he was not afraid to say that he's truly "gay!" when his friend told him to jump down and say some gay shit. People still think Trump was the winner of the election, HOW UNTRUE! The real meme queen of the election was Hillary Clinton, a true LGBT-rights supporter like iDubbbz! Pepe is a white supremacy meme, iDubbbz saying "I'm gay!" is a true act of LGBTQ+ rights activism in an amazing, well-thought-out meme.Rock is actually the single worst genre in music. I know fags like to say 'haha i like anything except country haha xD XD' but let's be real. First of all, if you say that unironically I hate you and second of all, it really should be rock. Let's take a fuckin look at 'rock' music. Let's take a look at one of the most popular rock bands, Radiohead. The name 'rock' implies music you can 'rock' out to, but who the fuck actually wants to rock out to some whiny depressing pony tail man wailing over beats that sound like they were made by Aphex Twin's retarded half-brother who likes putting guitar over things. If I ever want to kill myself but can't quite commit, all I have to do to push me over the edge is listen to Kid A. If one of the most popular bands in a genre makes me want to commit suicide, how can you call it a good genre?[removed]Uh... I don't sing the song. Other people do. This is very traditional in tv and radio. Gilligan doesn't sing Gilligan's Island theme song, for example. On The Late Show or Saturday Night Live, a narrator introduces the host and the casts.

But that's besides the point, which is that you're a loser, who can't make original thoughts so he "creates" something that's already been done. It's called a repost you clown, get your shit together and quit fucking crying over nothing. You bringing up "stalking" for the THIRD FUCKING TIME shows how out of juice your sorry ass is. Fucking get over yourself, you're just like the rest of the decrepit morons that scour garbage reddits to feel like you're somewhat relevant even though you still struggle differentiating YOUR from YOU'RE.

All in all, I think you get the point. You haven't embarrassed anyone, and you've made yourself look even more like a jackasses than ever before... I mean seriously... read your shit responses and tell me that there's some actual substance to any of the shit you spew. It's all empty-minded backed -in-a-corner "arguments" because you don't have any basis to work off of.

She was saying something about gun or birth control (can't really remember which one) and I just stood up and said "facts don't care about your feelings, snowflake". My entire class looked at me and I seized the moment by doing my most epicest troll face and then I said "trololololololol haha owned" and sat back down. My liberal classmates were so shocked at how epic my roast was that nobody said anything for a solid 5 minutes and just looked at me! Haha when you troll a feminise leftiste amirite.TIL💲2💲MIT💲grads💲built💲an💲algorithm💲that💲uses💲a💲7💲question💲quiz💲to💲pair💲people💲with💲wine💲they'll💲like.💲It💲has💲questions💲like💲"what's💲your💲favorite💲chocolate💲".Take💲the💲quiz💲to💲see💲your💲matches.💲Ok, this is ABSOLUTE fucking bullshit. I went to see Cars in the theater yesterday, and when Lightning McQueen got HOT with Sally in Radiator Springs, my boner engaged. When Lightning McQueen said "Ka-Chow!", I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using whip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and his mom got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on her son. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. You should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over your son, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the movie theater managers didn't agree with me. They KICKED ME OUT of the movie theater, and I didn't even finish watching the Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out? You CLEAN semen after its FRESH out of your cock, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT sex scene in a movie? Either don't ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in your theater, assholesObi-Wan doesn't need to be **on** the high ground, the high ground just needs to *exist* within the battle; Obi-Wan knows that when he has the low ground, he really has the high ground, from a certain point of view; see [Diagram A](http://imgur.com/a/MGopB). 

Look at his battle record:

Maul: Has low ground, wins [Example A](http://imgur.com/a/dZZvq)

Dooku: No high ground, loses

Dooku rematch: No high ground, loses [Example B](http://imgur.com/a/sV2gu).

Greivous: Has low ground, wins [Example C](http://imgur.com/a/jIe4F)

Vader: Has high ground, wins

Vader rematch: No high ground, loses

Obi-Wan with the high/low ground is canonically the most powerful Jedi. This is **fact**. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1. It took the Tusken Raiders years of conflict against Old Ben Kenobi to grasp his superiority in terrain advantage, as you see them visibly flee in ANH when they realize he holds the low (inverse-high) ground; this was the optimal strategy against a near-invincible opponent. 


Yoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, after falling from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats upon realizing he is on the lowest ground. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training. [Example D](http://imgur.com/a/UhgYZ)
.
Obi-Wan's defensive Form III lightsaber style synergizes with his careful military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground. (The business on Cato Neimodia doesn't count.)  You'll come to realize that this is why Commander Cody's artillery strike failed against Obi-Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master's elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable. (You'll notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise.) Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi-Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground. This is why Obi-Wan is so willing to fight against impossible odds to the point where [he thrusts himself in immediate danger](http://imgur.com/a/i2GwA); when your probability of victory is 1-to-10, you have the statistical (and therefore strategic) low ground, a numerical advantage when you use your point of view to flip the value to 10/1 . Almost losing is, in Obi-Wan's case, certain victory. (See [Example E](http://imgur.com/a/A5WwZ)).
 

As we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen One can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and could no longer use his signature trick, becoming the very thing he swore to destroy. Additionally, Anakin told Obi-Wan that, from "[his] point of view, the Jedi are evil". This broadens Anakin's mind to the concept of relativity in the context of the moral high ground, a mere step away from tactical comprehension. 

Anakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; **all** Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also the reason why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference (This also negates the spinning trick, as noted in [Example F](http://imgur.com/a/LfPDz)).


In ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground [Example G](http://imgur.com/a/wIi43).

Why was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left. [Image A](http://imgur.com/a/clEuG). As seen through the events of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan was known to be on friendly terms with Senator Organa, whose homeworld held large quantities of mountainous terrain, the *perfect* habitat for a Jedi Master. Grand Moff Tarkin was already in position to destroy Alderaan as a first target, as the distance from Scarif to Alderaan was too vast to reach between the escape and recapture of the Tantive IV, even at 1.0 lightspeed. Alderaan had been the initial target all along, as Obi-Wan with the high ground was the primary threat to the Death Star. How? Because a moon-sized space station would have some form of gravitational pull, thereby negating Obi-Wan's zero-gravity weakness; Obi-Wan with the perpetual high-ground in a low-orbit starfighter would easily be able to fire proton torpedoes through a ventilation shaft, although the Empire was uncertain of the specific weakness of the Death Star planted by Galen Erso (who was a good friend).

In Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was *no* ground, and should have covered that useless gaping pit which does nothing.

A common misconception is the idea of a 'prostrate position' version of the high ground, wherein Obi-Wan lies flat on his back, giving him tactical superiority from his point of view. However, this strategy is futile, as for the high ground to come into effect, there must be a differential between parties on both the x-axis and y-axis to a moderately significant variation from both absolutes (Angles only a Sith would deal in). For Obi-Wan's high ground powers to be in full effect, he must stand between 15 and 75 degrees (π/12 to 5π/12 radians) diagonal from his opponent(s) on any quadrant of the area circle; this has been dubbed the Trigonometric Perspective Diagram. ([Diagram B](http://imgur.com/a/SLLjR)). The total effect for conventional high ground advantage can be calculated via the MetaComm Equation, or  f(x) = lim 0→x  π/12 | 7π/12  5π/12 | 11π/12 Ʃ(x) (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) + (log10Δ)) * cΦ 

Δ = distance on hypotenuse (meters)

Φ = Surrounding Force [c (variable) * β (Earth Gravity) * (pressure (psi)/2.2)]

'x' refers to the angle of contact between the two parties on, with advantage being based purely on position on the Y-axis, as the vast majority of force users base their perception on elevation rather than spacial relativity. 

The power of gravitational force has great effect on the high ground; too weak, and the high ground holds no traction; too strong and the ground becomes the real enemy. Experimentation has proven that the high ground typically holds significant value between .8 and 1.4 β (Earth Gravities) with maximum impact standing roughly equal to 1.05. 

Pressure is equally important, as it is a surrounding force attached to gravity (the high ground has famously low impact in aquatic environments). Pressure(λ) is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), to be used as a gravity multiplier (or division if pressure is sub-atmospheric; Φ (Surrounding Force) is a variable defined as β * 2.2λ , with no metric value assigned due to its singular application in the MetaComm equations. 

In situations regarding Obi-Wan and his relativistic point of view, you must substitute the Quadrilateral MetaComm Equation (the Jedi Master function), f(x) = lim 0→x minmaxƩ (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) ) * (1.2)cΦ [min = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + π/12 ), max = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + 5π/12 ]. 

The viable Φ field is expanded, as Obi-Wan has taken advantage of the high ground in so many different environments that he simply uses it more efficiently, and the min/max values apply due to his multidimensional point of view, evidenced by the Trigonometric Perspective Diagram. Additionally, the distance factor does not affect Obi-Wan, as spacetime can be perseptively compressed, giving him the ideal Δ value from his point of reference.

In conclusion, Obi-Wan abuses spatial relativity and Taoist doctrine in order to always invoke his high-ground powers. To properly analyze the strategic genius of Kenobi, one must hold advanced knowledge in Philosophy, Mathematics, and Calculus-based Physics, and be able to integrate these topics together.

Where I live the Emoji Movie came out a day early (today), and so I watched it. Not many other people in the crowd, though that's probably due to the fact that I watched a kids movie in English in a non-anglophone country. Couple teenagers in the crowd.
Anyway, [it was not as bad as I expected, though of course not a masterpiece.] OR [it was a masterpiece, best movie of all time])

In the beginning we get introduced to some kid, I forgot his name, Andy maybe? Wait wikipedia says it's Alex. Alex then. Alex has a crush on Addie. The narrator says that everything revolves around phones and emojis blah blah blah. Then we zoom in on emoji city and we see Gene preparing for his first day at work, doing meh faces in front of a mirror. He goes out of his home and sees mama donut walking her baby donut holes. He tries to stay meh but the adorableness is overwhelming and he starts doing other faces. The babies cry and mama donut is disgusted and calls him a freak. He continues to walk and meet other emojis and he accidentally (literally) bumps into a couple of emoticons (like :-) and stuff) which are supposed to be the elderly. He then holds a balloon and flies to the center of the city and the emoji world, the cube. Standing outside the cube he does a bunch of non-meh faces and his parents see him and go with him to a private place to talk (a restroom). His parents say he shouldn’t go to work but then he says that everyone his age goes to work and then they see a poop emoji dad going out of a stall with his poop emoji son and the son shouts that it is his first day at work despite being just 10 years old. His mother changes her mind and says that he should go work and he does. Smiley emoji (female), who is the oldest emoji and by that virtue the head of the emojis introduces the new workers to the emoji mechanism. The emojis stand in boxes and then when Alex wants to use one it is scanned and uploaded to his text. His parents, watching say that Gene won’t actually be used. But of course immediately he is used and he does the wrong emoji and then everyone panics and the scanning and box mechanism in destroyed. Smiley Emoji says to Gene he is a malfunction and the next day there will be an executive committee meeting to decide what will be done with him. Then there is a scene with Gene and his parents on the roof of the cube but I forgot what’s in it. The next day Gene goes to the meeting to defend himself and he comes slightly after the end of it, and Smiley and Gene meet alone in the committee room and he is not allowed to defend himself and while inquiring what will be done to him she flosses and holds the floss in a way that while she flosses it looks like there is a noose around Gene. But anyway that is irrelevant to the plot and Gene is innocent and doesn’t understand that he is going to be killed and then Smiley tries to kill him with these robot thingies but he escapes. He then meets High Five who is trying to get back into the popular emoji club and who also saves him by hiding him in the unused emoji club in the basement (and yes the eggplant emoji is there). Gene says he wants to become a normal meh and High Five tells him that they can get to a hacker and the hacker can fix him and will also make High Five popular again. So High Five and Gene leave emoji city and get into the screen/wallpaper/whatever and while there they pass next to some messaging app and also facebook, and gene takes a look into facebook and then he says that Alex has a lot of friends but then High Five explains that they are not actually friends and that friends are not important just becoming famous or something like that. Meanwhile Gene’s parents also leave the city and go search for him in the wallpaper. Gene and High Five go to the dictionary app but it actually has a secret hidden pirate app (during this Gene says “What do children have to hide from their parents?” or something like that). Inside it is kind of like a club, with trolls, viruses, spam emailers, and trojan horses, and also the hacker, which is actually a girl who is called Jailbreak. Jailbreak initially doesn’t want to help them but upon discovering that Gene is multi-emotional does help them. Then the killer robots come and they escape to candy crush where Gene is stuck in the game, so they play the game and manage to rescue him. Alex is annoyed by noises coming out of candy crush despite him not playing so he makes an appointment at a phone shop to delete the phone. High Five has a candy addiction. Jailbreak explains that they need to get to the cloud, where the source code is, and then she will be able to fix them both. To get into the cloud they need to pass the firewall, which requires making a right emotion and saying a right password and she is about to say that that is why she helped them, because Gene can make multiple emotions, but then gene realizes it and say it before Jailbreak says it and then she says that all the time Men copy ideas from Women or something like that. She explains that she knows a shortcut to Dropbox (the cloud) through Just Dance (Apparently there is a Just Dance app http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple118/v4/89/1a/56/891a5685-ab85-edc9-08d1-02d245a9a8a5/screen696x696.jpeg). So they go to the Just Dance App and Jailbreak tells them not to turn the game on but of course as she finishes talking High Five presses the big red button that turns the game on. Meanwhile Gene’s parents look for him and go into youtube where there is this wall with one large screen, playing Pen Pineapple Apple Pen, and a lot of small screens playing videos (One of them was Good Mythical Morning, I don’t remember the rest, didn’t see jacksfilms). Then the killer bots come and they play a cute cat compilation to distract them. After they exit youtube the parents split ways because Gene’s dad is no longer the man that Gene’s mom knew because he didn’t support Gene. Cut back to Just Dance where they have to dance to Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go by Wham! or they die, High Five is a natural dancer, but Jailbreak can’t dance, so Gene helps her. While dancing, her hacker beanie falls off, and reveals a crown on her head, she is actually a princess emoji that escaped. They then ask her if it is true that when she whistles birds come and she says it is not true (this will be important later on). Then there is freestyle dancing to the tune of Feel This Moment by Pitbull Ft. Christina Aguilera and they do a dance that the in-game dance instructor (Voiced by Aguilera) has never seen before and they call it the Emoji Shuffle or Emoji Dance or idk something that starts with Emoji. The noises from the app disturb Alex during lesson, so he deletes the app. The group barely manages to make it and then one of the killer robots takes High Five to the void with him. They are right next to dropbox, but Gene wants to save High Five, Jailbreak is amazed, and Gene says “What is it worth to be number one if there are no other numbers”. They then take a romantic sail through spotify, the romanticism being cut short due to them reaching the end of the river. They exit and using some rope the got from somewhere rescue High Five from the garbage, saving him from a stalking, demeaning troll (The trolls, by the way, are green fat semi-neckbeards)(Also in the garbage is the crying, sad, slowly macarena dancing dance instructor). The troll tries to get out too by holding High Five, but he falls off. High Five, upon getting out, says that he was also once a troll, and unravels the rope for the trolls to get out, but he accidentally pushes it in while walking. ~~Meanwh- oh shit my taxi to the airport is here, I have a flight, will try to continue it from the airport. Anyway I'll just say the post credits scene is Smiley Face, with braces, playing cards in the unused emoji club, bye.~~ shit copied the wrong thing here is the correct thing: 
Meanwhile, two things happen- Gene's parents re-meet in the Instagram app (specifically inside Alex's picture from his family's Paris vacation) and Gene's dad reveals that everything that happened is actually his fault, as he is also a multi-emotional emoji, but he suppressed it. Also, with like 4 hours until the deletion appointment Smiley Face decide's to step up the chase and releases some kind of super-bot. The super-bot then attempts to capture/kill Gene while the gang is on the wallpaper but the manage to tie his super long arms together and get into dropbox, the evil superbot tries to enter dropbox but he can't because it's the cloud. Then they literally get into a dropbox, a box that falls, that leads them to the firewall. There, you need to match an emotion with a password to get through it. Each time Jailbreak gives Gene a different possible password and every time it fails and he gets burned. Jailbreak runs out of passwords, then Gene suggests that if he had a password it would be the name of the girl he likes. Jailbreak didn't find the name of any such girl, but then High Five recalls that while in the garbage he saw an unsent email that Alex sent to Addie in which he (High Five) was used. He doesn't remember the name of the girl though, and he suggests a bunch of wrong names, among them "Lupita" (Don't remember the rest). Jailbreak manages to find somehow the email and finds that the girl is named Addie, which is indeed the password. They get through the firewall, and are where the source code is. Jailbreak does some hacker things and manages to reprogram Gene and High Five, but before she executes it, Gene dramatically declares his love for her and that he doesn't want to be just a Meh. He is rejected, and it is so harsh that he becomes a meh without reprogramming. He walks slowly towards High Five, who is standing near the entrance, and suddenly the evil robot thingy somehow takes Gene away. High Five then tells Jailbreak what just happened and asks her what did she say to him. I don't remember what she answers but she does reveal that she can in fact call birds to her by whistling, and so she does . She whistles two times with nothing happening but after the third time a twitter bird comes and takes them away. Cut to the cube where all the emojis are and Gene, now Meh after his rejection, is held by the evil robot thingy. Gene's parents come in and Gene's dad says that if Gene is deleted he has to be deleted to, and reveals his malfunction/multi-expressionism. Smiley Face is like ok and the robot takes Gene's dad too. Then High Five and Jailbreak fall through the roof and onto the robot, and after a short fight High Five hits the big red button on the back of the robot, which turns it off. It falls and crushes Smiley Face. There are only a few minutes to go until the phone is deleted, and they decide that they should send an emoji for Alex to see, I think after they see through the phone camera that his crush Addie is also in the store but I am not sure. It is decided that Gene is to be sent due to his multiple expressions, despite him being stuck in Meh mode. Jailbreak operates the scanner, and she tells Gene to do the best emoji he can think off. As more and more of the phone is becoming deleted, just before everything is gone, Gene does multiple expressions while being scanned, which leads to this super cool 3d emoji (oh wait did I say 3d I meant animated) which is iirc a smile which transitions into a kiss which transitions into a blush. Alex sees it and immediately disconnects the phone from the deletion cable (Can't you delete a phone without going to a store? I'm pretty sure you can.) and sends the super cool emoji to Addie. He then approaches her and asks her out for the school fall ball and of course she accepts, because of course the animated emoji convinced her. Everything in the emoji world goes back to before the almost deletion, and there is a dance party to the tune of the Feel This Moment. Everybody does the Emoji Pump (Actual name of the dance I think) but in the midst of it they have to go back due to Alex wanting to send a text, pretty sure that he sends it at the same time as dancing with Addie in the ball. He picks Gene, who this time does some other animated emoji. Film ends, credits roll, and there is a post credits scene of Smiley Face with braces playing cards in the unused emoji club.Who is this "cummy" guy that comments on almost everypost here. All he does is just copy other peoples content and people shower him with upvotes? I dont get it. He is not original or funny. Cummybob is a leach on this community. Honestly who has the time to comment on all these posts? This loser must have no hobbies, no life and no friends. Nobody probably gives a shit about him in real life so he just goes on reddit and thieves other peoples work like the fucking bitch he is. If some guy ever copied my exact post just to get free karma i would kick his ass all the way back to the little swamp he crawled out of. Id beat his ass so good it would cure his autism. That little shithead just copies aka steals peoples posts? Where does he get off? Probably not with any girls thats for sure. He is probably a weaboo who jerks it to anime fags. This guy wouldnt last a minute in my streets. Im so pissed that the mods let this guy hang out here almost 24/7 to steal some karma. I made this account for 2 reasons 1) call people out on their bullshit anti dragon beliefs 2) speak my mind about this cummy bob loser 3) swindle some dumbass in the secret santa exchange Ive accomplished these and hopefully my message resonates with you guys.
For anyone who is "mourning" Chester from Linkin Park:

You're either willfully ignorant of cultural appropriation or blatantly racist yourself.

Do you morons not understand that rapping is black culture, and rock music WAS black culture before white people stole it (like they do everything), watered it down to make it more palatable​ for house wives, and sold it to racist, white teenagers? All Linkin Park did was continue the trend of stealing from people of color and give them no credit or reparations.

Linkin Park is a white supremacist band, and I'm glad Chester killed himself. It's the only way he could've made up for all the damage he'd done.👆👀👆👀👆👀👆👀👆👀 waaay up tHere 👆 moRTY ✔ im gonna need 👆 🌱 u to put these seeds 🌱👆🌱waaaay 👆up inside🌱🌱 ur✔butthOle✔✔🍑mo-EURGH-rty 🌱👆👆👆wa𝖺𝖠AY up there 👆 morty 🌱 way up 👆 into your butthole (chorus: ᵇᵘᵗᵗʰᵒˡᵉ) mMMMMᎷМ🍑 O0ОଠＯଠOooᵒᵒᵒᵒRR𝖱ᵣᵣTTY𝖸𝖸YY 👆🌱👆 🍑 👀👀 👀 👆 👆✔ waaay up there Gru is the most powerful being in the universe. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, whick means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking missiles at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the sixe of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. Plus after this Gru punches a chark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That's equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my caseHey Faggots,
My name is Scott, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day looking at stupid ass pictures. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess it's fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook.
Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "jack off to naked drawn Japanese people"? I also get straight A's, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash).

The first time I saw Phil was on a flex tape ad. He was sawing a boat in half and then slapped his flex tape on a fish tank. The way he slapped that tank made me feel something I’ve never felt before. I reached my hand into my pants, and started to masterbait. I moaned Phil’s name as I reached closer and closer to climaxing. “Flex tape is super strong” Phil’s voice echoed in my head. As I climaxed, I thought about Phil, I thought about the life we could live if we were together. I dreamed of having kids with Phil. But alas, it was nothing but a fantasy.Does anyone else find Mufasa's death scene sexually arousing? When Scar pierces Mufasa's paws and he cries for help I can feel the blood from my body slowly makes it's way down to my penis, which screams in lustful harmony as Mufasa cries out in pain. And then he lies on the floor, dead and still, as if he were a silent woman laying on her bed, fully nude, beckoning you to fuck her. Place yourself in the position of Simba; the man whom once dominated you in your everyday life now lies unable to be dominated - it is the dream of every sub to be the dom for once. Then Simba approaches his dead father and with his small, weak and subordinate yet at this moment powerful paw, begins grazing against Mufasa's soft pelt. Then he cries, the dominated breaks down once more even in the stillness of his dominatrix. Maybe it's just me, but I really get off to Simba crying over his dead father.( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ╯╲___卐卐卐卐 Don't mind me just taking the Fine Bros for a walk

I feel like I am Rick Sanchez while he was in middle school and I'm way smarter than my parents and teachers and I hate having to explain my superior intellect to all of the idiots around me.I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From this we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squared times height. This comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inches. Next I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, which according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing this number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. This means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume.Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.﻿Hi I'm 13 and I just started watching Rick and Morty and I can tell you for a fact it's my favorite show!!. Lik the one time Ricky said said there's probably like no good !!!! i was agreeing so much I'am smarter then you're average fidget spinner teen at middle school to even though I have one. I may be young but I'm smarter then every theist on earth basically the show is also really deep when they said like no one was born for a reason I was so blown away as they must have big balls to say that on tv so I told my friends on minecraft and they agree too. LOL once when my mom took me to McDonald's I asked for the Mulan dipping sauce and the dumb bitch didn't even get the reference XD One time in class i evan shouted "I'm PICKLE RIIIICK!" and Mrs.Janice told me to go outside i fucking hate that cunt school is for dumb ppl just like what Rick said, i m too smart for such imbicells. But yeah I love Rick and Morty and I'm actually smart enough to get it to.

I was 12 years old. Like all pubescent boys, I had an extreme fascination with girls and their bodies. Cue one night, watching TV, when my older sister, 16 at the time, walks past the screen in just the right angle, the bright blue and brown light from that episode of Tom and Jerry complemented her complexion perfectly. 

"Sis," I said, "you, uh, going on a date or something?" She always hung out with one of her boyfriends back then, and when she did, she prettied herself up with nice outfits and makeup. This particular night, she was stunning. 

"Actually no," she said. "He broke up with me..." She showed me a text on her phone screen from the bastard. Her eyes were teary. 

"I... I don't know what to say." Young boys don't know how to react to teen girl problems, but you're darn right if you say they try their best to ease them. "Your brother's here for you." 

"Thanks..." She glanced at the TV screen. Tom had just stepped on a rake, which sprung up and smacked his face. Her expression lightened up a bit. "Say, little bro..."

"Yes?"

"You know what would make your sister happy?" 

"No, what?" 

"Come with me, I'll show you."

At this point, I knew what was coming. My poor, innocent heart was beating. She led me to her bedroom, which smelled faintly of vanilla. Probably one of her scented candles. I never really went in there often, only when Mom wanted me to get her up for breakfast during the summer. She plopped on her bed and patted beside herself. 

"Sit with me." Her eyes were hungry.

"O-okay, sis..." I took a seat at her side.

"You know, I've seen what you look at on the computer when Mom and Dad aren't home... You should really learn to delete your history." 

My face turned red. I mean, I did usually watch porn, sometimes even hentai, at least once a day, but I wasn't ready to mention it to my sister, of all people.

"Don't worry, it's fine. In fact, I'd like to show you that it's perfectly okay to be curious about girls' bodies."

"B-but you're my sister..."

"And I love you like a family member should. It's okay."

"Really?" My body was quivering with nervousness.

"Yes..." She suddenly wrapped her arms around me and pulled me into her. I couldn't breathe.

"Sis!" I gasped. "Too tight!"

Whether she heard me or not, she refused to let go. I felt her heart beating perfectly in sync with mine, and at a high pace. Her hand ran down my back and to my thigh. A wave of peace went through me. I guess this was it, I thought. I'm really doing this with my sister.

Her hand slid to my pants zipper and undid the fly. She knelt down and reached in. With a sudden shock and a clenching pain in my stomach, she crushed my balls in her hand.

"You sick pervert!" she cried. "That's what you get for peeping on your sister! Yeah, I saw you last night when I was showering, you sicko! Trying to sneak into the bathroom for a glimpse! This ain't Alabama! I'm your sister!"

I cried, throwing up on the bedside from the pain. She kicked me out of her room and told Mom, who grounded me. So the next day, I snuck out of the house and banged the guy who dumped her.WOW!! cool! awesome!!!! those are things ppl (me lol :3) say to about you!!

🇿🇦 🇳🇪 🇺🇬 🇲🇦 A liberal muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, known atheist

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

”How old is this rock, pinhead?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian”

”Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named “Small Government” flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Semper Fi.

 The Emoji Movie unlocks the never-before-seen secret world inside your smartphone. Hidden within the messaging app is Textopolis, a bustling city where all your favorite emojis live, hoping to be selected by the phone's user. In this world, each emoji has only one facial expression - except for Gene, an exuberant emoji who was born without a filter and is bursting with multiple expressions. Determined to become "normal" like the other emojis, Gene enlists the help of his handy best friend Hi-5 and the notorious code breaker emoji Jailbreak. Together, they embark on an epic "app-venture" through the apps on the phone, each its own wild and fun world, to find the Code that will fix Gene. But when a greater danger threatens the phone, the fate of all emojis depends on these three unlikely friends who must save their world before it's deleted forever.
[removed]Today in school we had a substitute teacher in one of my classes and i pulled an epic prank on the whole class. When he had to leave the classroom for a few minutes, I went up to the whiteboard and wrote TROLOLOLOL in all caps (for those of you who dont know, this is the catchphrase of the Troll Face from Rage Comics). It took up like half the white board xD By the time he got back, I was sitting at my desk pretending that nothing happened, but all my stupid classmates were staring at me (they didnt get the reference). When the sub asked "who wrote this?" I was trying really hard not to laugh and i stood up whike making the same facial expression as the Troll Face meme and asked "problem?" I was expecting AT LEAST one of my classmates to laugh, but nobody did (like I said earlier, they didnt get the reference). Still standing, I thought of a new joke. I made the facial expression of Doge (a different internet meme) and i said "much troll. very epic." so everyone would get that it was a joke about the troll face. To my surprise, not a single person laughed, and after a few seconds of me waiting for everyone to get the joke, a kid said "sit down faggot". I asked if he went on the Four-Chan forums because they made up that word, but he just looked at me like I was the stupid one. By now, pretty much the whole class was yelling at me to sit down and shut up. I took this opportunity to make a Four-Chan reference, so as a joke, I yelled "FUCKING NORMIES" (because thats what Four-Chan calls people who dont get memes) and ran around the desks with my hands behind my back like in anime xD I got a lunch detention from the sub but it was worth it because i got to troll the whole class.Lmao reminds me of the time I was watching hentai with my dad (father son thing). We were watching until a bit where the dad was raping his daughter, then my sister came in and my dad came because we were foolin around, litttle did he know his penis was pointed at my face, went up my nostril and I started sneezing profusely. My dad has dementia btw.I have my mom help me out sometimes and i feel very awakard at times when she strokes on my penis. Now is that a normal thing to be awakrd haveing your mom help you out masterbating? Also my dad caught me the one time with my mom and he asked what were we doing and my mom told him, so he said she was doing it all wrong and he ended up helping me out and giveing me a few tips. Is there a better possible way of masterbating without my parents help because i have problems my self doing it, i tried even watching porn and getting tips and nothing is working.

Does my intellect make you feel small, perhaps? Or are you simpletons always so defensive? Perhaps its an evolutionary adaptation meant to curtail criticism. All of you poo-slinging chum gather together and hurl downvotes at my astute observation. Though, if enough people agree it must be true, right? I must be a fool? Ha, if only. I am mentally superior than the lot of you combined. Your collective brain capacity couldn’t contest even 5% of my capabilities. But alas, I digress, wondering why I’d even think you incapacitated stew of stupidity could even stand to reason with the likes of me.Omg hai ^__^ I’m anon-san and I absolutely luuuv @@ anime &lt;3 and my fav is naurto!!!

Nyaaaaa!!! (^_&lt;)
I see Amy Schumer as a challenge, more than anything. Here is a woman who, in every single aspect, is absolutely revolting - her exterior AND her personality - yet I can't help but wonder what would be like, to plunge balls-deep into her repeatedly.

That's right. Balls-deep. With no protection.

I won't lie, I'm extraordinarily-hard while typing this. I want to grab this... thing... and that's what Amy Schumer is, let's not delude ourselves, a "thing"... by the hips and ram mercilessly in and out of her quivering, malformed cunt with the force of a gladiatorial chariot, while she makes stupid faces and contorts orgasmically, unable to control her bodily reactions even if she wanted to.

I would erupt violently inside that corrupt and corrupting womb as though the entire fate of humanity depended on my seed penetrating the foul walls of one of her ovaries, the electrical fusion from this coupling creating the Antichrist, as our combined, guttural, Chewbacca-like roars shattered glass and walls alike around us, the house toppling down while we lay there in a filthy, disgusting mess.

Yeah. I reckon Amy Schumer does it for me.To be fair, you have to have a *very* high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from *Narodnaya Volya* literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly *appreciate* the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic *Fathers and Sons.* I'm smirking right now just *imagining* one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I *pity* them. 😂
And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.When a black person calls some white person a cracker

it's seen as a naughty joke.

But when a white person calls a black person a cotton-picking, bike-stealing degenerate jungle negro who should die as a slave with the rest of his melon-loving ancestors at KFC he's called a racist?⠀⠀⠀⣴⣴⡤

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈  Day 74 of no fap.. As I exited my vehicle to walk into work I caught scent of a female in heat 73.35 meters upwind. Because of the fog I couldn’t see her yet but judging by the scent she was mid twenties, and healthy. My ultra attunated hearing was able to pick up her gait, which put her at about 5’6”. My mind, free of the constraints of porn and indecent imagery, was able to calculate her weight based on the ripple in the testosterone continuum produced by her footsteps as she walked away from me. Being that I was 10 minutes early for work, I made chase and followed her through the fog still without visual contact. I was like a pilot navigating the white abyss by instrument alone. I was trailing her about 130m behind when I sensed her phone vibrate in her purse through the pavement. Holding my ear to the ground I was able to faintly pick up on the conversation she was having with beta BF. Based on the annoyed tone in her voice I knew now was the time to strike. I readied my legs and concentrated all of my Testo-chakras into my Vastus Medialus muscles as I assumed a sprinters starting stance. I exploded forward in a cataclysm of sex hormone fueled rage. Exactly 2.54 nanoseconds later I began to phase through time and space as I meshed with the testosterone continuum. As I phased through the helpless female target I nutted directly into both of her Fallopian tubes, destroying her previously unbroken hymen and causing her to orgasm INSTANTLY. As I began to slow down 33.6 light years later, I realized that while she would have wanted to thank me for giving her the gift of my superior seed that she was already dead and gone having raised my CHAD progeny to repopulate the earth. As I float into the the celestial abyss of the greater Crab Nebula I am not filled with regret for having left my world, but rather happiness for having left it a better place.If you don't know how to pronounce it, you can go ahead and call me Zach. I'm a 14-year old Highschool student. I love animals, hentai, coffee, ice cream, eating, shopping, TV series and music. I feel like a princesses most of the time I don't care what most people think or say about me. It really doesn't bother me or get to me unless I care about them a lot. Doesn't make me mean or tarrasqueless :) 



A few tips about me: 


• I have a couple mental disorders but WHATEVER (wow what an opening line) 


• I'm like, half Australian, half Japenese. I'm proud of both :D 


• English is my first language but you can speak to me in Japenese if you want 


• Send me hentai because I love hentai, mainly dick girlsFortnite takes place in the same universe as The Powerpuff Girls. Now, before you start ranting, hear me out. Fortnite has Thanos in it. Thanos is in Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite.  Mega Man X is in Marvel vs. Capcom, and Mega Man X in the same universe as Mega Man, since Dr. Light created both of them. Mega Man is in Smash Bros, and so is Pac Man, who appears in Wreck-it Ralph. One scene in Wreck-it Ralph shows a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade machine, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have a comic book crossover with Batman. Scooby Doo and the Mystery Gang show up in an episode of Batman. Scooby Doo, of course, has a crossover with Johnny Bravo. Johnny Bravo is in an obscure Smash Bros. ripoff for the Wii, called Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion. All three Powerpuff Girls show up in this game. Therefore, my conclusion here is that Fortnite does in fact take place in the same universe as The Powerpuff Girls.They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

The Ugandan Knuckles are a strange people. They flitter from place to place, sometimes grouping up and sometimes striking out on their lonesome. They repeatedly ask people ‘Do you know the way?’, but if you ask them what the way is, you will receive many many differing answers. They seek a Queen, but they never stick to one for long. As soon as one leaves, they go to the next, sometimes choosing men or monsters as their queens. They are violent-tongued and easily agitated, but their approach to vicious combat is to simply unleash loogies on their opponents, which seems to merely annoy them more than anything.

They speak in both human tongues and one of their own, a series of clicks that can be construed as almost a battle cry, but can also serve as a greeting. In fact, a taller, more normal Knuckles was able to prove he was one of them by speaking in this language of clicks, and they all accepted him from that moment forward.

Additionally, I’ve noted a few things about their biology. The reds seem to be the most plentiful, but also the weakest, yet the most aggressive. Almost like Chihuahuas. The blues have the words ‘Ugandan Warrior’ etched into their backs, indicating they have some higher combat prowess. Some reds grow larger, or assimilate other reds to form a single, larger hive mind body. The oranges are... mutants. Twisted things. Perhaps a result of inbreeding.

It’s unknown if they are dangerous, but they appear to avoid one specific place; Firelink Shrine. Perhaps they fear the onslaught of Giantdads that pour from that lost fragment of a dead world. Perhaps, a War of the Memes is all but inevitable.﻿
Holy fucking shit. I want to bang the animal crossing dog so goddamn bad. I can't stand it anymore. Every time I go to the town hall I get a massive erection. I've seen literally every rule 34 post there is of her online. My dreams are nothing but constant fucking sex with Isabelle. I'm sick of waking up every morning with six nuts in my boxers and knowing that those are nuts that should've been busted inside of Isabelle's tight dog pussy. I want her to have my mutant human/dog babies. 

Fuck, my fucking mom caught me with the neighbors dog. I'd dressed her in my sister's skirt and went to fucking town. She hasn't said a word to me in 10 hours and I'm worried she's gonna take away my 3DS. I might not ever get to see Isabelle again.The Spider-Man 2 Pizza Delivery Minigame is the pinnacle of modern gaming, and will stand as a monument to our society after we have been dust for Millenia.
With cutting edge graphics, an incredible, gripping score to rival the most earth shaking epics, and gameplay so immersive that even VR technology cannot match it to this day, the Spider-Man 2 Pizza Delivery Minigame remains to this date, the most important part of gaming history to ever exist.
It is said that within the code to this reality shattering epic of a saga, lays the secrets of the universe laid bare for all mortals to see. The only way our simple earthly shells can comprehend it is through the Pizza Delivery Minigame, offering us the closest glimpse to heaven itself of anything yet discovered by humans.
This divinity comes at a price however, as many have lost their lives enthralled by the Spider-Man 2 Pizza Delivery Minigame, and wasted away before their screens, unable to tear themselves away from this Utopian masterpiece of gaming, muttering to their last breaths, "pizza time, pizza time, pizza time"
I too have experienced the glory of this beautiful magnum opus of human achievement, and this is where I sit now, writing what could possibly be my last message ever.
I have seen the universe, and it is the Spider-Man 2 Pizza Delivery Minigame.Don't quote me on this, but Jack Sparrow could of said harambe is my friend you moron ayy lmao thanks Obama RemindMe! 2 minutes needs more jpeg autism speaksSo after a while of trying to lucid dream I finally did it! I realized that I was dreaming and was so happy that I had done it. I started thinking of all the things I could do within the dream. Then, I realized... I can have sex!

I thought to myself "When I turn around, there will be a hot naked girl behind me."

I turned around and what do you know... Hot naked girl! I took her over to my bed and I went at her *hard*.

After a while her moans started to sound... Masculine... I opened my eyes and discovered that the hot babe I was ramming had turned into some fat old dude!

I jumped and fell off the bed. The man looked at me and I thought "Wait... That's Danny Devito! What the fuck?!?"

And then an egg came out of his ass and he said "Can I offer you a nice egg in this tryin' time?"

Thank God my alarm went off right after that... No more sex in dreams from now on.my mom caught me masturbating for the first time. I was in second grade. I was sitting on my bed, curiously touching my penis. My mom walked in the room and saw. She sat down next to me on my bed where i was fapping. With my penis still out, she started to have some sort of parental conversation with me. She was confusing me, with such weird talk about “condoms” or whatever she called it. She smirked softly, then she put her hand on my dick. i was scared and confused. i’ve only seen these kinda things on television.
she then told me “sh, everythings going to be all right”. i was pretty nervous. 
She started to slowly stroke my dick, as i moaned quietly under my breath
“mom...”
As she increased her speed slightly, my dick started to twitch. I accidentally peed on mom.
“why is my pee white”
“this is called cum, sweetheart. its what happens when you see a very pretty lady, and she touches you here.”
Mom lays me on my back
“Hush dear, its going to be alright”
She takes her pants off. She then removes her panties. 
“This is a vagina. Its what you put your peepee into.”
Before i knew it, i was fucking mom.
“Oh my gosh, mom, this feels so amazing!”
“Oh yeah, right there, cum in my pussy OHH”
her hips started to furiously sway against my dick
“Ohhh mom, im cuming!”
“OHHHH”
Dad walks in.
“WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE!”
“Kenny! Its not what it looks like!”
“THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ITS NOT WHAT JIT LOOKS LIKE? LET ME SUCK HIS DICK”
Dad furiously pushes mom off my dick, places my dick in his mouth, and starts sucking.
“Oh shit, yeah you like dat shit, slut?”
“Oh my gosh! Daddy!”
He then inserts his 2 fingers in my butthole.
I blush
“MMMMMM OH MY GOSH”
I cum in his mouth.
“You did good, champ!”
“Thanks, dad!”

They think I got in because of my scholarly records, but no the key is the interview.

As I sat in the Harvard Dean's office in front of the board of reviewers for my application, the Dean asks me "Why should you be a good candidate for this school?" They seemed bored but I replied "Well I was born a child prodigy, placed 1st in my state spelling bee for three consecutive years, I can speak eight different languages not counting Latin, play four different instruments, I skipped grades 4 through 6, and graduated my high school as valedictorian at the age of 14. I then worked as an intern at both Telsa, and NASA." Suddenly the room burst into laughter and many of board instantly started scribbling down "No" near the application check marks. The Dean says "Sorry but you are just not the type we are looking for." But then I said "Excuse me but I wasn't finished... I watch Rick and Morty" The Dean looked at me like an idiot and said "So....?" Then I replied with a smile "And I understand all the references and subtle jokes" An audible gasp let out by the board was so loud the secretary had to come in. You could hear a pin drop and then suddenly all at once the entire board clicked their pens on the "Approved Box" and I was instantly handed a diploma and now I'm teaching advanced physicals there. I guess you can say I'm pretty smart. :)haha 😂 look at me 👀 im a teenage girl 💁‍♀️ im wearing a nirvana shirt 🎤 im cool and grunge 😎 oh yeah i love nirvana 😍 my favorite song is smells 👃 like teen spirit haha xD xD i got this shirt from a pacsun ☀️ its from my favorite band 🙌 nirvana with kurt cobain and the other two guys 🤷🏻‍♂️🧑🏼🤷🏻‍♂️  its so sad kurt got murdered 🔪 by his wife courtney cox 😭😭😭Number 15: Burger king foot lettuce. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse. 

The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfleld Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.

Now before any of you report me for shitposting hear me out. First according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall. Furthermore if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodges them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed. After this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine.

That’s equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.Let's do some math. There are 9,211 words in the bee movie script. The word "Bee" is said throughout the movie 173 times. 173 x 9,211 is 1,593,503 So if the original script has 9,211 words, minus out the bee there will be 8,938 words Adding 1,593,503 to 8,938, you will get 1,602,441 words in your requested script If you read 4 words per second, it would take one 4.6 days to read it all without stopping.

CummyBot is vengeful and him and his 1000s mini bots will hunt you down. Thanks guys, you've fucking ended humanity's hopes'Watch Me Whip' is literally the worst song I have ever heard

The song "Watch Me Whip" is single-handedly the worst song I have ever heard. Before you get all bent out of shape, I do know that it's not to be some intellectual masterpiece of modern art; it is just factually a shitty song. Here's why:

* Repetition: 

This song takes repetition to a level rivaled only by songs written for 3 year-olds. The singer repeats his name a full 6 times before the third verse, just in case you were wondering who 'wrote'? No vocalised the script put in front of him.

There were 980 'words' in this song. Is nae a word? Scratch that, I truly don’t care. Of those 980 words, three variations (Now watch, now watch me, watch me) represent 369 words. That’s more than ⅓ of the song for literally 3 words (and I didn’t include the single mentions of the word ‘me’). If we include ‘ooh’ (there are 84 instances) and ‘bop’ (there are 72 instances), which total 156, we have 525 out of 980 words made up of 5 words.

I think we get the picture on this.

* Simplicity: 

The most complex word in this song is a tie between ‘Silento’, the vocalist’s (not an artist in my opinion) handle, the word ‘already’ (which appears literally once), and the word ‘superman’. Doing a quick tally, that means that 15 single word instances are 3 syllables. All the rest are 1 or 2 syllables. The vocabulary is not strong with this one. Look at that! My use of ‘vocabulary’ beat out this song by 2 whole syllables!

* The culmination of the two previous points into the dumbing down of everyone who had the displeasure of hearing this song: 

Pretty self-explanatory. Look, I get that the writer wasn’t going for a Pulitzer or a Grammy, but a quick hit that’ll be catchy and easy to remember. Fair enough. EXCEPT FUCK YOU YOU’RE LITERALLY RUINING MUSIC. Who am I to say what should and shouldn’t be written? An asshole, that’s who. One who is procrastinating other, important work.

Basically, by putting music out that has a grand total of about 30 unique words, you’re contributing to the lowered standard of quality of music. This is one step away from repeating one single word over and over for 5 minutes straight, which now that I think about it probably exists. Except that would have some comedic value at the very least. This shit, well it’s like a kindergartener took a crayon and drew a stickman (poorly, I might add), that was subsequently put up in an art gallery. Real, impressionable children will listen to this and think “ Wow, dad was wrong! I CAN skate in life only knowing less than the bare minimum needed to be able to read ‘See Spot Run’, which I never did because fuck books and education”. (Side note - That interaction wouldn’t have been possible outside the child’s head, since there are too many unique words used)

Now put on your tin-foil hats, because this is where I lose half of you with my bullshit. Songs like this promote the opposite of education. Like I said, it devalues a halfway competent vocabulary in the name of catchiness and a cheap ‘musical’ fix. When you see what can be presumably defined as success (ie having several hundred million views on Youtube and countless other radio plays), it sets a standard in young, impressionable minds. We’ve had many people trying to get past this dumbing down of society, like KRS-ONE, Stevie Wonder, John Lennon, and many others (No, of course not all of their songs). They were trying to create a more engaged people who reflect on the actual issues we face as a society, instead of making up a cute little dance to go along with your shitty track as your brain melts from lack of use.

Who is the target market for this song? For all the reasons I’ve brought forth, I believe the target market to be the typical vapid, vacuous consumer that doesn’t engage in critical thought related to anything more than whether the Kardashians look better in blue or teal. I realise that I’ve made a broad, fairly baseless claim, and yet I’m confident it’s pretty accurate.

Songs like these placate the masses with their simplicity and safety. You don’t need to think, you don’t need to guess what it’s talking about, you just need to follow these three easy steps and you too can conform to the newest dance craze. Independent thought is the antithesis of this track. By listening to this, you are using time that could be spent thinking of ways to better the city/country/world you live in. Again, I realise that not everyone WANTS to engage with the world like this, but I will still stand by the claim that critical thought is better than being herded like a goddamn sheep by pop-music.

So what have we learned today? Well, mostly that I’m way too mad about a song. That’s a given. What I want to really stress is that this song is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand. Like the CIA funneling crack into ghettos, to me this type of music represents a concerted effort to quell independent thought. Ultimately it’s easier to listen to a catchy song with like 7 words than to actually sit back and think about why everything is kind of messed up.

I really, truly fucking despise this song.Let me just cut to the chase. Sportacus has a Number 10 on his shirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means something, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie, the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in his secret lair, keep note of this, He looks around the town to see weeds, an abandoned basketball court, and other very polluted things. He seems content about this, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on his shirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on his shirt! Was this careless mistake? Or something more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in his tracks and is visibly distraught about this, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps down to meet Stephanie, she asks him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says "Another one?" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought him aswell. Think about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has his signature secret lair. However, he doesn't use it for evil, he doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they are, lazy. So, why would he have this lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? Think about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now are you ready for the biggest stretch in this entire theory?

Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of this group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it himself.

In a little known song called "We Are Number One."Jenkem has changed my life.
I used to be addicted to marijuana. I was hardcore addicted. I remember sucking dick for a hit of some purple haze on the streets of Philadelphia. My life was going nowhere and I had cut all connections with all of my family and friends. I was a wreck. Every day at 6 AM I would stumble into my apartment, breath smelling of semen and pot, landlord yelling at me from his window to pay the rent or get the fuck out before he blows my brains out, and crash onto my bed. I'd sleep all day until 9 PM, then I'd go out and do it all again. Marijuana was the center of my life. It controlled everything I did. Any action I ever took was always to get a hit of the Devil's Lettuce. It was inevitable that soon it would be the end of me.
One night I managed to score an entire gram of marijuana. I had never been so ecstatic in my life. I found a nice alleyway and put the whole gram in my tin foil pipe at once. I smoked the entire gram right then and there. The last thing I remember was trying to stand and seeing Satan, standing at the other end of the alley, ready to take me to hell. I accepted I was going to die and fell over. I gave up. It was over.
I woke up 3 days later in a hospital. I had been in a coma. The doctor told me it was the worst marijuana overdose he had ever seen. A homeless man had found me in the alley and gotten help for me. They said I barely made it and I was lucky to be alive. I had no visitors at the hospital. In fact, my family didn't even know I was ever in the hospital that day. They still don't. I checked myself out of the hospital later that day and as I was leaving a dirty, scruffy looking man approached me. He told me he was the man who'd saved me. I thanked him but hurried away. I knew I should say more, or at least make my thank you sound more convincing, but I didn't want to face reality. I didn't want to believe any of that ever happened. I just wanted to smoke some more pot and forget. I was right back on the streets looking for someone who wanted their dick sucked in exchange for marijuana. Before long I ran into that homeless man who saved me again. He told me he could help me. I told him I didn't want help. But he insisted I listen. He said he had something better than marijuana. Something that could make my wildest dreams come true. Something that was completely free. He hooked me in when he said it was free. He handed me a balloon. He said to huff the gas inside. I didn't even question it, I just inhaled.
It was like sucking a fart out of my Uncle Ronald's ass. It was terrible tasting. I was only able to hold it in for a few seconds. I coughed and gagged and vomited everywhere. It felt as if my lungs had literally filled with shit. I couldn't breathe. But after about one minute, it all changed. I took a deep breath. As fresh air filled my lungs I felt something that I never felt before. It was a feeling that I didn't know I could feel. I was standing on a hilltop, looking out at the sunset. I was experiencing the most intense euphoria ever. I turned around and there was my family and all of my childhood friends having a picnic. They smiled at me and invited me to have some potato salad. I gladly accepted. I ate the potato salad and talked and laughed with my family and friends. I felt so happy, I started to cry. Just then my landlord came up to me and told me I could stay in my apartment for as long as I wanted, and I would never have to pay a single dollar. Soon after, a beautiful blonde woman came to me with a suitcase. She opened the suitcase to reveal $5,000,000 in cash. She whispered in my ear, "It's all ours babe." We then kissed. One thing led to another and soon we were making sweet passionate love right where I had been eating with my family moments ago. It was the best experience I ever had. It was a shame when right before I came I suddenly woke up in the alley feeling lame and full of shame. The homeless man stood over me and told me I'd been out for three hours. He asked how it was. I told him it was life changing. And it really was.
Since that day 8 years ago I have completely turned my life around. I stopped smoking marijuana. I was finally able to end my craving for it by doing jenkem every day. I do three balloons every day- one when I wake up, one after lunch, and one before bed. I make it all by myself, only having to spend money on balloons. My wife disagrees with my jenkem use, but she allows me to do it as long as it keeps me from doing marijuana. And yes- I am married now. After I discovered jenkem and stopped smoking pot I went on to go to law school and become a successful attorney. I ended up falling in love with the sister of the homeless man who saved me. She is not homeless. She is a beautiful woman, who looked much like the one from my first jenkem experience. Her name is Martha and I love her more than anything in the world, besides our two year old son Daniel. Since finding jenkem I have also started talking to my family and old friends again. They are all very proud of me and it feels great to once again have their support and their love. As of now, Martha, Daniel, and I live in a very nice house outside of Hollywood, since Martha is an actress. I love my life right now. It's damn near perfect. It's all thanks to jenkem that I could be here today. If I stopped doing it, I'm not sure what would happen. But so long as I can shit, I can keep making it, so I don't have to worry about that. If you haven't tried jenkem, I would recommend it. It could do for you what it did for me. It is truly a life changing substance.
As for the homeless man who helped me out so much, he's dead. He overdosed on crack about a week after he introduced me to jenkem. - That's how I met Martha- at his funeral. Anyway, I just wanna take this last bit of time to thank that homeless man. You were my guardian angel. You helped save my life. You taught me to jenk. Thank you. Fuck I wish I could remember your name.PLZ READ THIS IMPORTANT REVIEW CAREFULLY! --------------------------------------- This is the best app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😀😃🤣!

Half of her chromosomes are from her dad and half of her chromosomes are from her mom. But so are yours. Therefore, every time you have sex it's 50% gay and 50% straight. So if u ain't bi then quit having sex. Y'all motherfuckers make me sick.One time in 12th grade when we found out the schools furry was banging the other furry (both dudes) and the one was deathly allergic to peanuts

So we dragged him into the school locker room and rubbed peanut butter all over his face and made him swallow some while yelling "how do you like these nuts faggot"

Though we didn't call him a furry because that's mean.

He started foaming at the mouth and having a seizure while his throat swelled up.

We forged a suicide note and left it on his body.

To this day his parents and the school thinks it was a legit suicide.

Comedy gold I tell you 😂Shrek has been a foundation of America for many years. I feel as if Shrek represents our great nation more than a mere eagle. It would set an example for the rest of the international community to choose something that represents their countries as a whole, a change for the better. The people of America deserve more then a bird, they deserve the symbol of free-thinking prosperity. Shrek is the true epitome of the American dream. Shrek is not white, not asian, not black, Shrek represents true diversity by being green. For America to take up the mantle as a bastion of diversity and free thinking, Shrek MUST become the national bird. Some may say "But Shrek is not a bird" BUT, that represents the true meaning of progressive acceptance. Shrek may identify as a bird, and we must honour that. I plead to you, fellow Americans, make this country as great as the values it stands for.Who else missed the old bladee talking about swords, magic, games and just shit that doesn’t fucking exist haha. It was so goofy but he made it sound so good. I was listening to his Plastic Boy verse and really made me think how his style of lyrics changed. serena please go out with me I’m a good man and i will respect you and give you all the attention you want please i’ll do anything for you my queen please serena don’t go to those disgusting jocks like chris who only like you for your body serena i love you because you’re beautiful on the outside and inside please serena just give me a chance Dear 4th Wave Feminists of the Western world,

Almost every single brick in every single building you have ever occupied was put there by a man. Almost every single inch of road you ever traveled on was put there by a man. Almost every single watt of electricity you have ever used was produced and carried by a system, almost every inch of which, was put there by a man. Almost every single drop of water that comes out of your tap was filtered by a complex system build by a man, and carried through pipes in the ground that were put there by a man. Almost every single gadget you ever used, and almost every single line of code written for that gadget, was created by a man. Almost every single bullet fired (or suffered) to protect our safety and freedom was fired (or suffered) by a man.  Almost every dangerous and dirty job that serves the society you enjoy, from mining to deep sea welding to garbage collection to oil drilling to electrical line power installation to construction to logging is done by men. Almost every single piece of modern technology that gives you your comfortable life was designed, build and then distributed to you by men. 

I'm not telling you to bow down and kiss our asses or anything like that, or that we're your superiors, or that women have nothing to contribute. [I am asking you to recognize that we take care of a lot of the worst shit for you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp8tToFv-bA). 

You need to stop [pretending that every man in the modern world is out there oppressing and raping you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oqyrflOQFc). Take that bullshit where it belongs - over to Muslim countries and other assorted 3rd world backward hellholes where women actually don't have equal rights, where they aren't given every opportunity like you have here in the Western world. Go "take a stand" that is actually brave.

[Evil White CIS Shitlord](http://i.imgur.com/A4bbg0S.jpg)If I clone myself and get him to suck my dick, is it gay???  All these recent scientific developments have got me thinking. I think human cloning will possible in the near future. Having said that, I need to prepare for it and ask the hard questions now so there's no need to wait later. I just want to be able to dive right into the experimentation. I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Ok, so cloning myself. If I clone myself, wouldn't my clone want the same things I want? If I want him to suck my penis, surely he'd want me to suck his as well.  And considering I don't want to have to suck his penis, that would mean he wouldn't want to suck mine, right??? This is a real dilemma. How do you think this will play out? Am I thinking about it the wrong way?  I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  Also, I've heard that clones sometimes have violent tendencies. So should I be worried about him trying to bite my dick off? He'll no doubt soon realize that his only purpose is to pleasure me with his mouth. What if he sees me if his evil creator? And what if he starts to tell people I'm gay? I'm not gay. I'm really not gay.  You want to know why I love Wednesday frog? Wednesday frog is a completely self-made meme. So many other memes are based in nostalgic childrens shows, funny faces, relatable situations, or references. Not Wednesday frog. Wednesday frog is completely absurd. It's a low-res generic toad, and an arbitrary method of celebrating Wednesday. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not do so out of recognition. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog did not do so because a pre-existing meme format. The first person to ever upvote Wednesday frog upvoted a meme literally pulled from the ether by sheer human creativity and willpower. Wednesday frog is evidence that humans can stare into the meaningless void of eternity and force their own meaning onto to it. I will always upvote Wednesday frog, my dudes!Stephen Hawking here,

 Swimming is eliminated right off the bat, as you wear a speedo and play in the water with other men. Secondly, I will be eliminating Basketball, Soccer, Football, Volleyball, and Rugby, as these games involve touching balls, which is gay. Wrestling is eliminated for A. being not real, and B. being gay as fuck. Now of course sports like Baseball, Hockey, Tennis, Golf, Lacrosse, Croquet, Polo, Ping Pong, Cricket and others like it are gay. This is because you are handling both a sick and balls, which is really fucking gay, more so than sports where you just handle a ball. In the case of hockey, it is slightly less gay than the others due to the fact that only a stick is handled. And to all of you degenerates who say that a racket isn't a stick, you're just all flat out wrong.
Track &amp; Field, as well as Cross Country must also be eliminated, as anyone who would wear shorts like that clearly have no respect for their own manhood. Despite being neutral, Gymnastics must also be eliminated due to the unfortunate uniforms that men wear. Now where does this leave us? Well, through my extensive research, I have concluded that the least gay sport in the world is solo men's figure skating. Why you might ask? It is because the man can wear what he pleases. Additionally, there is no handling of a stick or balls involved, and most importantly, is done alone with no other men around. Therefore, Solo Figure Skating is the least gay sport known to man.Edit: Wow, this really blew up!

ignorance to sarcasm had surrounded me as a child.  I vividly remember every time i visited reddit i would feel a strange ache in my right testicle.  At age 12 i was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and my right testicle was about the size of a small orange.  The cause wasn’t known, and it wouldn’t be discovered for several years.  I kept reading reddit comments, and after a year, my right nut had a tumor about the size of a grapefruit.  Numerous tests were done on my young frail body, and eventually, a link between Reddit comments and testicular cancer was found.  Years later, a scientific paper was released, informing the public that ***/s*** was a dangerous carcinogen.  Your comment is part of the problem, and thanks to people like you, my left testicle has developed a tumor about the size of a pumpkin.  Thanks for the testicular cancer, jackass.o.o ..... &lt;.&lt; .... O.o... Hold on, lady. You... are a.. girl gamer? *Shifts in chair, tugging at collar* &gt;.&gt; A fine, alluring lady such as yourself... Also has an intellectual side? With your ravishing, simply bewitching beauty, you pull me in...And then you penetrate my level of understanding of perfection..By informing me that you, are indeed, a girl gamer, who plays Minecraft!!! O.O My beautiful lady. I will treat you right forever, I will cherish and treasure you, I will mine you diamonds and protect you from Endermen. My lady.. be my player two....I sexually Identify as a Neutron Star. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of spinning at the speed of 0.24c and emitting radio signals at the frequency of 716 Hz. People say to me that a person being a neutron star is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install astrophysical jets, hot quark-gluon plasma and super hot surface on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “PSR J1748-2446ad” and respect my right to emit pulsating radio signals. If you can’t accept me you’re a neutrophobe and you need to check your stellar object privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911. Here's why: Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead. Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it. Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12. And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal. Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger? Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova. Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound. I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series: "Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1." And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

So there's a chick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her 'big and though' boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for judo practise out in one fell swoop. "Go ahead" I say. The gun is only 400 years old while the sword is the child of many millenia. Do you fancy the odds?" Instantly the gang-banger drops his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer while her jock boyfriend pretends the whole thing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I don't smile because I was only doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and youll face your worst nightmarerape is always the victim's fault. 100% of rape incidents could have been avoided if the victim consented ┏━━╮┏┓┏┓╭━┓┏━┓ ┃┏╮┃┃┃┃┃┃╭┛┃┗┓ ┃┃┃╰┛┃┃┃┃╰┓┃┗┓ ┗┛╰━━┛┗┛╰━┛┗━┛  ┏━━╮┏┓┏┓╭━┓┏━┓ ┃┏╮┃┃┃┃┃┃╭┛┃┗┓ ┃┃┃╰┛┃┃┃┃╰┓┃┗┓ ┗┛╰━━┛┗┛╰━┛┗━┛  ┏━━╮┏┓┏┓╭━┓┏━┓ ┃┏╮┃┃┃┃┃┃╭┛┃┗┓ ┃┃┃╰┛┃┃┃┃╰┓┃┗┓ ┗┛╰━━┛┗┛╰━┛┗━┛(●----●) SWIGGITY   　 ∧\_∧ 　 ( ･∀･) 　⊂ ⊂　) 　　 ( (  (　    　　(\_(＿)  Swooty 　　              ∧\_∧ 　　　 　　( ･∀･) 　　　 　   ( Ｕ   つ 　             　 )  )  )                   (＿)\_) I'm    ∧\_∧　　   （ ･∀･) ⊂\_へ　つ 　(＿)｜ 彡　(＿)             Coming                ∧\_∧　　                (･\_･)っ                (っ /                 Lﾉ┘      For that 　 ∧\_\_\_∧ ⊂(・＿・ )  　ヽ ⊂二/ 　(⌒)  /      Booty!! ／　　　　　　　 ＼ |　　●　　　　●      |    ＼　       \_  (•\_•) &lt;)   )╯ When you're ready /    \\   ( •\_•) &lt;(   (&gt;  Come and get it  /    \\   (•\_•) \~(   )\~  NA NA NA NA /    \\"  (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻ FLIP DAT TABLE.  ┻━┻ ︵ ヽ(°□°ヽ) FLIP THIS TABLE.  ┻━┻ ︵ ＼(\`0\`)/／ ︵ ┻━┻ FLIP ALL THE TABLES  ಠ\_ಠ Child. . .  ಠ\_ಠ Put.  ಠ\_\_ಠ The tables.  ಠ\_\_\_ಠ Back.

Oh my fucking god, I think I might hate Japanese this year. Last year we had a teacher named Ms. Noguchi, she was an old woman from japan, but her classes were serious and quiet. We had tests every other day. But she retired. Now we have this one woman who learned Japanese at PSU who makes the classroom look more like a GOD DAMN anime with kawaii posters everywhere and we also sit in FUCKING GROUPS LIKE BRAIN DEAD KINDERGARDNERS. She said she got interested in Japanese through anime and THIS LARDED FUCK STARTED TALKING OUT LOUD TO THE TEACHER ABOUT HIS FAVORITE ANIMES WHEN SHE WAS STILL INTRODUCING HERSELF. Also outside in the hallway there is a display case that used to show old japanese artifacts, NOW THERES JUST FUCKING MANGA BOOKS IN THERE AND OTHER SHIT. My god I wanted to learn japanese because it was different not to look like a FUCKING WEEB.I want to have hot steaming sex with Marge Simpson, I'll look like the cookie monster from eating Marge's pussy and ass. Homer does not need to know and Marge won't tell because i know that she is actually a freak. I'm gonna go baby Bart Simpson on her tits because I'll be treating those tits like actual jugs of milk. I will look like that kid who ate mud because I know that she doesn't clean that sweet yellow ass of hers. The bed will be soaked in sweat and pussy juice from our passionate fucking, the bedroom will look like she was attacked by an animal which actually won't be to far from the truth.  The smell of cum, pussy-juice and sweat will stay in the room for weeks. She won't be able to walk properly for three whole days, just imagining this is making me so fucking horny right now like holy shit. I can see marge sitting on my face while moaning the classic sound she makes when she is angry. Her moans will be heard all over Evergreen Terrace and Ned will have to cover the ears of his children from the unholy noises.  We can try to choke her with that blue hair of hers,  when I feel her shivering because of the intensity of her orgasm both of us will know it was worth it. She will scream in pain when I penetrate that pussy but that won't stop me from going harder and harder until she is filled to the brim.  I will expand her anal cavity as if my cock was one of those torture tools.  No amount of lube(not that she will use any anyways) will make this experience painless for her but I know that it is what she want's because when I blast that ass like a naval cannon she will turn around and beg for more. I'll fuck her till every hole in her body is filled with my seed. Her face will look like the Joker in The Dark Knight   after I'm done .  Come to think of it those sweaty thighs can rub my claymore.  Our session will be so violent that we will have to keep a doctor on speed dial just for safety. So in conclusion I would have sex with Marge.thank god vine is finally dying jesus christ. meme is already kinda dead that vine is bad yeayeayea we get it but seriously tho vine isnt funny. instagram is/will be normies go to from now on, some side social memeia platforms are facebook, ifunny, and maybbbeee snapchat but not really for memes. some facebook content is better than a lot of instagrams content but its still awful but the only source of a constant flow of memes that are neato and better than the rest. im very unique and cool and quirky as you guys can see. holy guacamole who remebers the spork meme holy shit. also all the weird videos me and gabe found like a few years ago are coming up again. i was watching a pyrocynical video because i really wanted someone to ramble for 20 minutes about a topic that could have been covered in one minute, all while trying to be on everybodys side at once as not to lose any viewers. im tired. anyways, i was watching the pryo video and he played that song from that guy that sang "goodbye to all the people.. who hated on me; goodbye to all rhe people.. who didnt believe in me...." or something i cant remember but hopefully you can gabe- the audio quality was horrible it was amazing lol

.Atheists are fucking retards. They took a method designed to study the natural world, applied to supernatural concepts DIDNT FIND SHIT and said "Fuck it! theres nothing there!" GENIUS! Next time you get a boner, crash that bad boy into a solid wall a dozen or so times then say "theres no such thing as pussy!" and tell me you arent a retard, you fucking retards![removed]Yeah, because if you could legally break other people's doors you wouldn't do it.


No door would be safe. I would be a door-breaking machine. The Un-Door-er. Open doorways would be an epidemic, baby. Houses full of flies, unregulated temperature, guitars breaking from lack of humidity control, I don't give a flying door. Call me the Dooradicator, sweet pea, because all you're opening when you get home is a bottle of hard liquor to drown your sorrows about the pile of splinters you stepped over to get inside today. Good luck replacing it too, 'cause I'm hitting the retailers as well. Telling you bitch, not a single door in the continental US is safe from my door-rending wrath.߷߷߷vvsssssshhhhhh[removed]Copied and pasted in all its glory. This guy was 1000% serious. 


Uh huh. Keep telling yourself that. Keep talking shit about people you don't know on the internet. It's a nice safe thing to do. No one will beat the fuck out of you on the internet for running your fucking mouth. That's why you retreat here to do it.

For the record, I'm not a homophobe. I don't have any problem with a person's sexual preferences and my dick is just fine. It gets me off every single time (I actually have a very satisfying monogamous sex life with a beautiful woman who also has no problem getting off, but just to make sure I am satisfying her I don't let myself come until she has several times). Truth be told if I had the option I may add a little girth to it if I could but I don't think it's necessary and I certainly don't lose sleep over it.

The question is what the fuck is wrong with a bitch like you that you come on to a social media sight and throw insults at large blocks of people and then act enraged when someone slings an offhand insult back at you? Fuck off man. Start going out in public and making your insults to people's faces. Pathetic motherfuckerSeriously, I’m a mobile user and I’m sad Cummy is gone Thanos spoke honestly. “i seek balance. by killing the half the universe, we can preserve peace. Will you join me?” he inquired.  The bald man burst into a fit of laughter. “ah, that is your folly. you believe human growth can be stalled. no, we to wipe the slate. we need to have a clean start. and if you intend to stand in my way,” Mr. Clean said, Magic Eraser in hand, “I’ll clean you like a stain on a kitchen counter.” so guys, we did it. we reached a quarter of a million subscribers, 250,000 subscribers and still growing the fact that we reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal i-i'm just amazed, thank you all so much for supporting this channel and helping it grow I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome. so as you can probably tell this isn't really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video so in this video i'm quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel and what kind of direction its headed. okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tomorrow a huge company could come along and claim that video as there's and we have no control over that. and any video we use that product in could either get copyright striked or lose monetization, meaning that all the money made from that video would get sent to the company, and not us. the only real way to counter this is to get advertisements placed on my channel, i mean its a win-win for everyone involved you know i get a safety net generated for myself and the company gets exposure and you guys, my sub subscribers, sit through a two second ad that will be as short and painless as possible, so next i'm gonna talk about the future of this channel, this doesn't mean in anyway that i'm actually quitting montage parodies, its basically why you subscribed to my channel and i enjoy making them and there's no reason to quit because i'm in full time education i have less time to make and upload videos it use to be weekly uploads and now its pretty much once a month but in my opinion uploading once a month isn't enough id like to upload more than that, i mean, as much as possible but montage parodies take a long time to make, collecting the resources, coming up with an original idea ya know, all this stuff takes time and planning and that combined with me being in education means that they take a while to make, a good video that goes into detail about this is rubber Ross's video "future of independent animation on YouTube" it is a different theme'd video because I don't do independent animation, but you can still kind of relate because uploads become more infrequent; channel traffic slows down this is why i want to make videos that are related to montage parodies, but aren't exactly meta montage parodies, like I said before: i'm not quitting montage parodies, its basically seen as either you wait for me to upload one video a month or i upload one video a month with a bunch of you know, funny game-play stuff in between.

I'm a fifteen year old faggot that wants to kill myself, I'm a racist, sadistic, satanist nazi, If you're reading this its for one of two reasons, I've made you mad and you're reading my profile to find something against me, or you're here to complain about how shit at csgo i am. I'm emotionally dead and pretty fucking pathetic, I hate myself as much as I hate Furries, If I've pissed you off, what are you doing with your life? getting mad that a 15 year old long hair prick made fun of you during game, re-think your life mate, honestly. 
What the fuck, /pol/ needs to realize that nobody cares about their stupid imageboard for lonely fat virgins. They think "haha we made Trump win with our epic memez!!!" and "a bunch of randomly repeating numbers on a moronic imageboard caused le Emperor Trump to win!!!!" No, it's because enough people voted for him you stupid greasy fucking pricks. It wasn't because "Kek blessed us with le epic quads of truth!!!!" But I wouldn't expect them to know how the voting system works because they're fucking uneducated morons who think they caused their candidate to win because of stupid fucking memes and randomly repeating numbers. Fuck them so goddamn hard it's not even funny

The humor isn't subtle, and without a solid grasp of humor a typical viewer would enjoy the jokes. There's also Rick's "nihilistic" outlook, which is half-assedly woven into his "characterization" - his personal philosophy does not draw heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they don't have the intellectual capacity to truly realize the shittiness of these jokes, to realize that they're not funny- they don't say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who like Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they would appreciate, for instance, the "humour" in Rick's "existential" catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is random bullshit made up by the writers.  I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons laughing their heads off in stupidity as Dan Harmon's cancer unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO post Rick and Morty content on r/CringeAnarchy. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.Hi!!!! I am new to Reddit but believe me when I say, I am a serious gamer. Some of my favorite Nintendo games are super mario, 1-2-switch, and sonic the hedgehog.

So a couple years ago I worked as a waiter in a little country style restaurant. It had been a long shift with multiple broken plates, glasses, and mostly spirits (Fuck being a waiter). So the afternoon shift is starting to come in for the day when I decide to take one last two-top table. It was a younger black girl and and white guy. They were both maybe 18, and being a waiter I could tell it was a date and probably the first. This is where it gets good.

The host sits them and I give them a couple minutes to converse and figure out their drink choices. Now this is my last table of the day and I know guys usually tip well on dates and it's been a rough day so I put on a smile and walk over. The guy orders a sweet tea and the girl order a water and coffee with cream and sugar. So I ask the guy if he would like a coffee and he says "yes". "Okay fantastic! And would you like and cream or sugar?" And then he says the thing I'll never forget. "No I like my coffee..Quickly glances across the table African American".

I seriously was flabbergasted. It was probably the most hilarious thing I've ever heard yet the intense cringe of a thousand suns kept my laugh in. The girl was obviously astonished. I just said "Okay. Black. Coming right up." And scurried away as the guy sat looking horrified as he realized what he had just let slip. I go tell my manager and he nearly collapses from laughter. I get the drink and go to bring them out and they had left. No idea what happened to the happy couple. But I am sure that young man has sat up many nights questioning his existence and why the hell he would ever say that. I know I still lay awake til this day and I was just a bystander.

So there’s a chick in my class I like; unfrotunately im quiet, calculated and intelligent and she likes big dumb jocks. So anyway one day me and her boyfriend are walking among a group of our felow students when a gang banger appears and threatens with a gun. Her ‘big and though’ boyfriend instantly freezes and loses the ability to speak. I on the other hand squint my eyes and step forward pulling my katana for judo practise out in one fell swoop. “Go ahead” I say. The gun is only 400 years old while the sword is the child of many millenia. Do you fancy the odds?“ Instantly the gang-banger drops his weapon and runs. My other classmates cheer while her jock boyfriend pretends the whole thing was funny. She looks at me and sees what she didnt see before. She thanks me with a kiss, but I don’t smile because I was only doing my duty. Safe to say she saw who a real man was that day. I may be quiet and collected, but raise a weapon against me and youll face your worst nightmareHang on fellas I got this!

Hugh is a word, and last names get pretty funky.

EDIT 1: She is really loud.
EDIT 2: If his name is Hugh Mungous, can you see how dealing with this behavior might also constitute harassment.
EDIT 3: Hey, wanna hear a joke?  What's black and white and red all over?
EDIT 4: "We should call the cops and see if they can detain this woman, she's such a nuisance."
EDIT 5: That's a lot of pie graphs.
EDIT 6: @Zana Do you find you're being marginalized based on a group you advocate with?  Or a demographic that you happen to be a part of by definition?  Luckily for you, you will not be marginalized her by any group you advocate, endorse, or stand with.  You will also not be marginalized for your race.  We reserve the right to marginalize individuals for being a public nuisance.  This is what happens when people collectively marginalize someone.  (Here is where I would show the previous video as evidence that this does happen.)
EDIT 7: @Zana It appears that was you in the video.  Fortunately, for the purpose of the root clip, and under the pretense of running what is effectively a maze, I realize I might, indeed, be this metaphorical rat.  It is okay, though, because you were not marginalized for sexual harassment.  You were marginalized for harassing a man over his name.

Hugh is a common household name among men, and its rooted from the English Isles.  The joke here, at least perceived, is that the man is 'humongous.'  I see, very clever indeed.  Unfortunately, this joke is 'unfunny.'  I know what your supposedly open-mind is thinking, "Unfunny is not a word."

I had to look up marginalize.  So can we call it even and look up the definition for 'unfunny'?  Unfunny is something which is not funny, but attempts to be.  In this sense, the man may have been making a rib, suggesting lasciviously that he was large.  Here are a couple of observations I have made:

1.) He his rather large.
2.) Your insistence that he was referring to his genitalia, which is what you were insinuating, let's be clear, is, in my honest opinion, a projection.  It's a projection that when you heard "Hugh Mungous" you thought of how big his genitalia might be.  It was such a strong gut reaction that you decided to make a scene, meaning that out of all possible contingencies, excluding the very reasonable one in which he was merely providing his name, and the very possible one that he was simply blowing you off with a joke, the only thing you could think of was how large he was, understandably because we live in a world where, in certain circles and in certain places, such as the internet, dealing with Unfunny Jokes is commonplace.
3.) He was walking away.  This is the universal sign of "I don't want to be here."
4.) If it were a joke, it was in his right to say it.  That's his First Amendment in the making.  He can also get a name change to Hugh Mungous in case it wasn't his name, or it could have been an alias.  It could have been a nickname, or it could have been his real name.  You see how this little episode afterwards was merely you getting ahead of your.
5.) If he, or anyone else is sufficiently disinterested in what you have to say, you will be marginalized.  This is not because of other people.  This is solely because of you.  
6.) This instance of marginalizing you was not patriarchal.  It's his name.
Even the assumption that he was referring to his genitalia wasn't patriarchal.  He may be proud of himself.
7.) Thank you for at least giving me something to talk about without actually saying anything spiritually, humorously, academically, philosophically, or personally fulfilling.  It was productive, however, so I could let you know that it wasn't sexual harassment, in my opinion.  I'm using reason.
8.) The mere mention of this in such a strong manner is known as an accusation in the English language, specifically the accusative case.  In this instance, you're accusing him of sexual harassment.
9.) Just use his first name from now on.  Hugh is a really nice name.

@Hugh So, it's really Hugh?  I like it.﻿
This so-called "music" does not compare with the refined melodic and harmonic modalities inherent in Baroque and Classical music, specifically the high-class compositions of counterpoint master Bach and distinguished master of chromaticism in minor, F. Chopin, whose musical brilliance eclipses and ultimately obscures the noise that is inflicted upon us here.  This profane garbage is an insult to the auditory senses!  It is also offensive to the great master composers to refer to this God awful noise as "music".  Please!  My delicate sensibilities are offended and cannot bear to listen to it any further.  I will now retreat to my study and immerse myself in the melodic and harmonic bliss of Bach's Passacaglia in C minor.﻿The waiter says "Say When", grating the parmesan cheese over my pizza. Foolish mistake. Anyone should know that there is no "when". As parmesan fills the restaurant, the pizza only gets better. After only an hour, the restaurants interior its completely filled with parmesan, killing twenty. But the resuraunt is only the beginning. Next the USA will be taken by parmesan, a force stronger than anyone could have anticipated. After that comes the world. Consider this a warning, to get to a foreign planet immediately. At least that will provide temporary safety, until the parmesan rises to mars. At that point, there will be enough cheese on my pizza, and I will be ready to eat.When you step into the Rick and Morty fandom realm, you're not going any old place. You're coming to the underground fight club of intellect. Prepare to be mentally battered. But don't worry, after you've spent your newbie time being cognitively pummeled, you'll have joined the ranks of the mental elite. 

Then you'll see the world for what it truly is. All those people going around without a thought in their head. You'll hate it. You'll become just like him. And you'll start loving it. The power of intelligence, of absolute intellectual superiority. It'll become a high you chase, constantly learning and experimenting. 

You'll finally be a Rick.

None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit.  Men puke, men poop on the field, men deliver their new born baby on the side lines.  Fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball foosball fuck it chuck it game time shit. Hey Faggots,

My name is John, and I hate every single one of you. All of you are fat, retarded, no-lifes who spend every second of their day trying to 'get good' at this kid's game called Fortnite. You are everything bad in the world. Honestly, have any of you ever gotten any pussy? I mean, I guess it's fun pretending your 'skill' in this shitty game matter because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to picture of your mother after spending her money buying shitty skins pretending you worth shit.

Don't be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I'm pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than "jack off to cartoon pixels"? I also get straight A's, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash). You are all faggots who should just kill yourselves. Thanks for listening.

I finished taking a shower and in the process of drying myself I looked at my penis. (It took me a while to decide on which appropriate name to use)
Well, here's the weird thing. I apologized to it. Yes. I told my penis I was sorry for the 14 years of abuse. Beating it almost every night. There was a warmth that flowed through my head when I was apologizing. Maybe it's my brain forgiving my soul for taking it hard on myself all these years. Sounds all woo-woo, but it happened.
But seriously, there have been times where I've masturbated till it hurt and I would still beat. So there's that.
Science tells us that the constant visuals from porn do have an effect on our brains. You go down a rabbit hole if you're addicted.
My point of this post. None really. Just wanted to share with you that I apologized to my penis. Let's see where things go from here.CUMMY IS BACK EVERYONE. 💦💦😍Oh wow! You had SEX! Congratulations!

Just kidding.

Having sex is literally the most basic, desperate, tragic, hopelessly-void-of-meaning, outrageously obnoxious, troublesome, costly, and downright pointless cry for help that the universe has ever screamed. Wow, you were born as an objectively good looking, decent looking, or perhaps borderline acceptable member of your species. WOW! INCREDIBLE! You managed to procure a willing (which in evolutionary terms, willing translates roughly to "fucking desperate for at least a few reasons") mate and managed to somehow perform the act of intercourse with her! WOW! This his literally only been taking place for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FUCKING YEARS! WOW! Except guess what, you probably wore a condom... which means you failed at submitting yourself to an act which means absolutely nothing. The only thing left to do now is kill yourself.﻿-	wake up☑️

-	wait patiently for all the girls to reply to the story ☑️Well, I'm here to tell you, iT'S FUCKING GAY. If I walked up to you right fucking now, me being a dude and you being a dude and you get turned on by me that wOULD BE GAY. It's no different from fucking traps. Just cause they dress like a chick that means they are a chick, they got a dick and iT'S GAY. AND DON'T THINK DICK MAKES IT CUTER CAUSE THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT CUTER. IT MAKES IT EVEN GAYER. THAT MAKES YOU GAY BITCH. AND YOU SEND ME PICTURES WITH THEIR LITTLE SKIRTS LIFTED UP AND THEIR NUTS HANGING OUT. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT SHIT. I'M NOT GAY LIKE YOU. STOP SENDING ME HENTAI. STOP SENDING ME ANIME PICTURES. STOP SENDING ME TRAPS. OH MY GOD

For fucks sake, this trap obsession is getting out of control. Just the other day I was hanging out with my mates and we saw a hot lady walk by. I said, damn look at that lady I bet she has nice boobies and all my friends were like Haha yeah lol Haha and then my friend was like yeah and she probably has nice DSLs and we all were like oh snap lol Haha and then my other friend said and I bet she has a nice ghrobbing cock too and then my other friends were like yeah Haha but I was like woah I want her to have a vagina so I can put my penis in it and then my friends started making fun of me and they called me pussyboy and started punching me in the shoulder and they kept making fun of me for never having sucked a girls penis and they were relentless until I was crying and then finally they all started kicking me while I was laying on the ground and they left and I was just sitting there in the dust 😔 

So basically I'm not too glad about how traps are now mainstreanDon't quote me on this, but Jack Sparrow could of said harambe is my friend you moron ayy lmao thanks Obama RemindMe! 2 minutes needs more jpeg autism speaks to the mods +/u/User_Simulator /u/Cummybot2000[removed]Ok, this has been driving me crazy for seven movies now, and I know you're going to roll your eyes, but hear me out: Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.

Here's why:

Think about how quickly the entire WWWIII (Wizarding-World War III) would have ended if all of the good guys had simply armed up with good ol' American hot lead.

Basilisk? Let's see how tough it is when you shoot it with a .470 Nitro Express. Worried about its Medusa-gaze? Wear night vision goggles. The image is light-amplified and re-transmitted to your eyes. You aren't looking at it--you're looking at a picture of it.

Imagine how epic the first movie would be if Harry had put a breeching charge on the bathroom wall, flash-banged the hole, and then went in wearing NVGs and a Kevlar-weave stab-vest, carrying a SPAS-12.

And have you noticed that only Europe seems to a problem with Deatheaters? Maybe it's because Americans have spent the last 200 years shooting deer, playing GTA: Vice City, and keeping an eye out for black helicopters over their compounds. Meanwhile, Brits have been cutting their steaks with spoons. Remember: gun-control means that Voldemort wins. God made wizards and God made muggles, but Samuel Colt made them equal.

Now I know what you're going to say: "But a wizard could just disarm someone with a gun!" Yeah, well they can also disarm someone with a wand (as they do many times throughout the books/movies). But which is faster: saying a spell or pulling a trigger?

Avada Kedavra, meet Avtomat Kalashnikova.

Imagine Harry out in the woods, wearing his invisibility cloak, carrying a .50bmg Barrett, turning Deatheaters into pink mist, scratching a lightning bolt into his rifle stock for each kill. I don't think Madam Pomfrey has any spells that can scrape your brains off of the trees and put you back together after something like that. Voldemort's wand may be 13.5 inches with a Phoenix-feather core, but Harry's would be 0.50 inches with a tungsten core. Let's see Voldy wave his at 3,000 feet per second. Better hope you have some Essence of Dittany for that sucking chest wound.

I can see it now...Voldemort roaring with evil laughter and boasting to Harry that he can't be killed, since he is protected by seven Horcruxes, only to have Harry give a crooked grin, flick his cigarette butt away, and deliver what would easily be the best one-liner in the entire series:

"Well then I guess it's a good thing my 1911 holds 7+1."

And that is why Harry Potter should have carried a 1911.Theres a reason fem bowser, and as an extension, fem Bowser r34 has become so popular. Bowser was the first real evil video game person many of us faced, and for most, the first big hurdle we overcame. That rush of beating him for the first time was the first sense of accomplishment many of us faced and ever since then we've been chasing the green dragon trying to recreate it but never quite being able to. However now we've been given a chance to dominate him again in a manner like never before. To make him our little slut and bend to our every male fantasy. To hear him moan and feel him squirm beneath us as we make him do whatever we want. And even better its been transformed into a heterosexual format so theres no sense of shame we might feel. The video game community may never be the same again as we've entered a new age where beating the enemy isn't enough. We must now dominate them and make them totally and undeniably ours. So every time we ejaculate all over the screen jacking it over fem Bowser porn, we're taken back to when we first heard that victory tune, and it gives the most blissful orgasm you will ever experience.Yo fam im new!!!!!!! holds up mixtape my name is Daquan but u can call me t3h N1GgA oF d00m!!!!!!!! bruh…as u can see im a real savage. thats why i came here, 2 meet 💯% no chill ppl like me… im 16 years old (i got first hand street experience tho!!) i like 2 Netflix n chill w/ my sidepiece (cuz you know this ain't my main one, smdh) bcuz da pussy is straight fire!!!! shes savage 2 of course but i want 2 meet more savage ppl =) like they say the more lit the squad the more lit the pussy!!!! lol…neways i hope 2 make a big squad here so give me lots of retweets!!!!

Of CITHi 👋 guys(and girls and transgenders and blacks👍🏿), it took a lot for me to tell u this and I’ve known this for about a month ⏱ now, basically i was at a party and I had sex (yes I am 16) with a guy(it’s not gay if the balls didn’t touch) i barely know 😎😜😜 and I stared throwing up 🤮 and was worried 😧 I was pregnant 🤰 so took a test and it came back positive 👍, please don’t confront me about it yet as I’m still getting over it 🤾🏿‍♂️ but I needed to tell you before I started to show 👀 😞xx    👋😧 ⬛  |  😧
          ⬛  |   👈👧
    ------------------------
      😧 😦  |   😟         
              |        ):&gt;Stop commenting my post on my post. I know you're trying to get a reaction, and I know you're gonna do it on this post but at this point I'm blocking everyone who does it. It's not funny and they're a right pain in the arse to delete.My best friend and I got married so we could have better health insurance and work benefits. We sometimes give each other brojobs because men need release, you know?

Eventually adopted a kid to be our bro. We raise him like our own and we're all really cool with each other.

But the other night we were going at each other and our balls touched and he didn't say "no homo". Did I marry a gay guy?Ben LONG SCHLONG 🍆🍆🍆ShapirGOD ruthlessly PENETRATES 😩 😩 liberal CUCKS with the STIFF BLACK superior white STAFF 🍆  🍆 🐛 of LOGIC and FACTS 😵 .
Bent over LIBTARD 😲😲😲😲 gracefully accepts 👉 HOLY 🙏 FACTUAL QUIPS sprayed DEEP within their LOGIC HOLE. 😩🍑🍆💦💯  😩My many final points: believe nothing and impress no one on here. 

99.99% of the time a "fact" is just an opinion that pleased the hivemind. 

I am also surprised to see the word "hive mind" used less and less. As Reddit grows it becomes more and more like it. 

I remember when 1000 karma was the top comment score, or when the shitty morph was me putting the Loch Ness monster and tree fiddy at the end of a story. I still do it, sometimes I will literally be a bit of a cunt and interject "tree fiddy", and when it works I get all sorts of praise. 

I was the other half of a Reddit legend. 300-700 karma a comment would put me at top almost every time. 

This site is incredibly predictable, to the point where I know the few people that read this may find it pretentious, or recognize me, or just upvote because they're clicking on anything. It's a lot like gambling, literally anything can get downvoted to oblivion or upvotes to the top at any time. Only on here, the points don't matter so I'm not actually gaining or losing anything other than time. Jedi would have others from this Earth, mark my class in the Sith legend. Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s a Sith her target. I will shit hi every1 im new!!!! <--- me bein random 2 of course but not to live forces. You thin

**Spoiler**: Frozone meets sans and sans kills Mr Incredible then Frozone says the n-word and then pointed to some random guy in the seats and blurted “Hey, this nigga eating beans” and everybody laughed. Also Frozone’s wife is revealed to be that main villain after Frozone loses his super-suit again. And there’s a really extended sex scene with Violet and Tony Ridenger in a club that I felt was unnecessary, that’s where the flashing lights are.Cummy💦you⭐️were😩my🍆🍆daddy🏳️‍🌈and🖕🏿now😤youre🅱️dead😫😫please😭come😵back😢and🥖fuck🥒my🌶🌶cummy🥚assDear Amazon, I bought a toilet seat because I needed one.

When I was 18... 18 years old, I saw for the first time in my life... I saw an image of clarity. I saw a comic strip... a three panel comic strip that, though simple as it seemed, changed me... changed my being, changed who I am... Made me who I am...



The strip, Garfield, the comic strip was new... no more than maybe a month and a half since inception, since... since coming into existence... and there it was before me in print, I saw it... a comic strip... What was it called?

Garfield.

The story here is of a man, a plain man. He is Jon, but he is more than that... I will get to this later, but first let us say that he's Jon, a plain man.

And then there is a cat... Garfield.

This is the nature of the world, here. When I see the world, the politics, the future, the... the satellites in space, and... the people who put them there...

You can look at everything as a man and a cat... two beings, in harmony and at war...


 Jon Arbuckle, he sits here, legs crossed... comfortable in his home, and he reads his newspaper... The news of the world, perhaps... and then he extends his fingers lightly, delicately... he taps his fingers on an end table, and he feels for something...

What is it? It is something he needs, but it is not there.

And then he looks up, slightly cockeyed, and he thinks... His newspaper's in his lap now, and he thinks this...

Now where could my pipe be?

This... I always come to this, because I was a young man... I'm older now, and I still don't have the secrets, the answers, so this question still rings true, Jon looks up and he thinks...

Now where could my pipe be?

And then it happens... You see it, you see... it's almost like divine intervention, suddenly it is there, and it overpowers you...

A cat is smoking a pipe.

It is the man's pipe, it's Jon's pipe, but the cat... this cat, Garfield, is smoking the pipe... and from afar, and someplace near, but not clear... near but not clear... The man calls out... Jon calls out, he is shocked. "Garfield!" he shouts.








Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. 

Edit: This blew up. RIP my inbox.

Wow! I love Verizon™! I’m glad that the internet is so free! Isn’t it great to say whatever you want and have your opinion represented equally across the internet! It’s really great! Good thing Verizon™ has spent millions on having that removed I’m sure they won’t abuse it! Thank you Verizon™! I love Verizon™! Don’t you love Verizon™?! Say it! Say it! Say you love Verizon™! Can’t you see they’re protecting us from all those small businesses who want to steal a fraction of their market?! Don’t you hate those people disagreeing with you?! I sure love Verizon™! Thank you Verizon™ Thank you for sticking your gold plated rusty knives up our asses and looking us dead in the eyes and saying “this is what’s best for a free and open internet” and slowly twisting it deeper and deeper until we eventually just give out and shit money into your fat wallets! 

Edit: missed a ™xxxtentacion got shot but honestly bts has gone through so much more. The hardships they've faced aren't even comparable to getting shot dead. Until xx has done what bts have done I don't feel sympathy.Summer 2015 my family and I went to Florida for vacation and we went to Busch Gardens for a day. It was an oddly gloomy and rainy day, but we still went because it was one of the last places we wanted to visit. It was a two hour trip from our resort, so I had alot of junk food and typical road trip food (think chips, cookies, and sandwiches) on the way there. By the time we arrived at Busch Gardens, I already had an upset stomach. I distinctly remember having tapioca pudding at the entrance as well, and since i’m a little lactose intolerant, this made my stomach feel even worse. I was pratically shitting myself by the time I was at the park. I thought I was fine however (i wasnt) so I decided to go on the “Falcon’s Fury” ride. Normally drop tower rides aren’t scary for me, but this one was different. You see, normally drop tower rides go all the way up and drop you down quickly, no tricks no gimmicks, it’s all predictable. Falcon’s Fury wasn’t. Falcon’s Fury did things a little differently, i’ll explain: When you’re at the very top of the ride and think you’re gonna go down, it turns the seats to a 180° angle, so you’re facing the ground, almost as if you’re falling to your death. It scared the shit out of me (hahah). On my way down, I must’ve let myself and my anus go, so when the ride ended and I was exiting my seat, I felt a warm and horrible sensation. You know how it feels like. You’ve been through it. That awful sensation. I immediately rushed to the closest bathroom but the damage was already done. As I helplessly tried to disguise the horrible stench and stains on my clothes I started crying just thinking how my family are gonna roast for shitting my pants at 16 years old. I realized 10 minutes into the hopelessly trying to mask the smell my shit filled clothes I had on that it just wasn’t gonna get away. With a defeated look in my eyes I went to my parents and told them what happened, they tried consoling me but couldn’t stop laughing at the same time, I felt so defeated. After my parents collected themselves we all went back to the resort. We went to Chick Fil A on the way back, so it was alrightI sexually Identify as a trebuchet. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of sending 90 kilogram projectiles soaring through the skies to land on disgusting foreigners 300 meters away. People say to me that a person being a trebuchet is Impossible and I’m fucking retarded but I don’t care, I’m beautiful. I’m having a plastic surgeon install a counterweight onto my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Trebuchet" and respect my right to kill from 300 meters away and kill needlessly. If you can’t accept me you’re a trebuphobe and need to check your seige weapon privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.[removed]I thought not, its not a tale the weaboo would tell you. It's a Pink legend. Papa Franku was a Dank Lord so filthy and so wise, he could use the dick to influence the bitches to create...life. He had such a knowledge of the Dank Side, he could even keep the ones he cared about...from weaboos. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power...which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught pink guy everything he knew. Then pink guy killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death...but not himself.There's no such thing as "racism" and that's a FACT. My little boy Justin has a nigger friend in preschool and he is a pure white kid with good Christian blood. Justin plays with that negro every day even though I have read some news stories to him that tells about negro rapists. Justin is a smart nigger loving kid and as a good American father, I'm not going to take his nigger friend away from him. Hope Y'all learn a lesson here and let those niggers be free even though they might rape you but that's just a part of their culture.EVERYONE RAISE YOUR MIDDLE FINGERS TO LUCY AND SAY (FUCK YOU BE A NON CRABBY PEANUT CHARACTER OR GO TO FUCKING HELL!!) SERIOUS I HATE THAT BITCH!!!😡 WHEN YOU WATCH A CARTOON AND YOU FIND A CRABBY PERSON AND IT GETS YOU OFF TRACK THAT'S WHAT YOU FUCKING DO TO HIM/HER FUCK YOU LUCY AND FUCK YOU SCHULZ!!! SHE DESERVES THIS BECAUSE SCHULZ IS A DUMB STUPID ASSHOLE,SO FUCK YOU SCHULZ YOU SHOULD HAVE THINK OF A BETTER PEANUT CHARACTER THAT IS NOT CRABBY,YOU NEED TO WAKE THE FUCK UP,BECAUSE I AM REALLY PISSED OFF!!!!!!😡😤You fucking do that every damn time I try to talk to you about anything even if it's not important you just say K and to be honest it makes me feel rejected and unheard like nothing would be better that that bullshit who the fuck just says k after you tell them something important I just don't understand how you think that's ok and I swear to god you're probably just gonna say k to this but when you do you'll know that you're slowly killing me insideSomething seems weird about him...Goddamn these threads make me realize why I hate black "people" so much. You've whined for 5 decades straight even after being made equal. You've been lazy for decades, not advancing your status in society through work but instead complaining to get more benefits. You have free scholarships and diversity quotas but still manage to stay on that bottom rung of society. You complain about the White man whilst taking his hard earned money in benefits. You circlejerk about how inferior Whites are whilst complaining that Whites can't be robots, and essentially admitting us to be superior.

You attempt to pretend you consider us inferior whilst simultaneously worshiping White women- you know it is the only way to upgrade your nigger genes. If it wasn't for those slave ships, you'd have been born in some village with huts made of cow shit, dancing around a fire in your pants whilst your children starve.

Black people are a dead branch on the evolutionary tree, kept alive only by the supreme kindness of your White superiors. I have nothing but disdain for you, I hope your stay on this Earth ends soon.i alredy know peopel are gona say this is stupid but listen befor you judg. cos i jus finishd watchn the avengers and i was thinkin about how fuckd up the world is at the miniute with terrorists an shit so why doesnt the government start producin superheros?       
                             
if they pick a bunch of orphens and train them from babys in combat and inject them with diffrent stuf like radioactvity and steroids and shit and make rthem ultamate fighters because thell already be angry about havin no parents so al theyl need is training an injections. then we can use them against isis and robers and rapistsCalli🆖📞📲 all staff

So I took out my phone, opened my dank meme soundboard app and cranked the volume to max. My phone screamed "you do not know de wey!"and I myself let out a godly autistic screech as I dabbed three times and punched her in the right tit. But then I remembered that I had forgotten to take my calcium pills and my wrist snapped on those melons and as I started crying, I pulled up my suspenders and screamed "SAD PEPE FACE!" before I ran back to my house. Now my hand is in a cast I can't use a mouse to create more dank memes and play Roblox. 

Suck for what? Ring fighting? Sure. But its a totally different story if you're trying to kill someone with a knife while he's in armour. Ditto for a girl trying to use effective self defense.

Lets not forgot traditionally most fighters WERE and STILL are AMATEURS ( even in boxing and western fighting sports). I mean Savate fighters were getting their asses kicked by Asian fighters but the Asian fighters were often military guys while the Savate fighters were professors who did mostly university work or some other nonfighting profession. In this same period other fighing styles including many wrestling styles and kung fu were losing to karate fighters and only boxers (and wrestlers who work in the military or some other physically intensive job) along with the few Kung Fu styles that practise realistic could keep up.

However as seen in recent years Savate was able to do some succes in MMA and a lot of the best kickboxers came from Savate background.

To bring up the comparison of Kung Fu and Boxers, lets not forget boxing is VERY LIMITED for how well it can be used without modifications. A Wing Chun fighter in an extremely narrow alley way (even amateur if he's been thought proper hitting mechanics and done some physical training) would easily wreck most boxer in this alley. Good luck using Muay Thai on a frozen pond which is the kind of situations military Sambo esp special forces level train for.

Ditto with an MMA fighter getting destroyed by a part time Silat fighter in a jungle environment.

Hell even an old man who's out of shape that he can't use his cane properly anymore can easily KO Mike Tyson if he's committed enough to throw a blow.

The point is styles like old Jiu Jitsu were created to fight under circumstances OUTSIDE THE RING. By that logic Iado is useless because Iaodo often loses in dueling even back in the Samurai times in specialists of its ancestor styles). However Iaodo was CREATED against to fight from ambushes especially when you're sitting down at the table.

Brock Lesnar and Dempsey would get slaughtered if for example they had to fight a Shiaolin style specialist in a rocky mountainous environment. Ditto with battling against an Israeli commando outside the ring (who probably wouldn't even show himself and instead do an ambush).

Different purposes for different movements in addition to having to train realistically.Just me and my 💕daddy💕, hanging out I got pretty economically unstable🍆 so I started to pout 😞 He asked if I was down ⬇for something revolutionary 😍🍆 and I asked what and he said he'd give me his ☭commies!☭ Yeah!

Because you're fapping to something with one guy in it, that's 50% gay. If you watch futa fuck a girl, that's one girl and a half girl, thus only 25% gay. You could make it 0% gay with two girls but the problem is, that makes them lesbian, which wraps back to being 100% gay.I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum superposition of grand opening and going out of business sale.

It is both and neither at once until an observer records the state at which point it becomes one or the other.

But because you know exactly where the store is located, you cannot know how fast it is going out of business because of your uncertainty about its business momentum.

All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores are popping into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe.  Without the pressure of this quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.

We can see evidence of this when a pair is created such that one half is within the sales radius of a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.The fucked-up porn my wife doesn't know about:

You've whined for 5 decades straight even after being made equal. You've been lazy for decades, not advancing your status in society through work but instead complaining to get more benefits. You have free scholarships and diversity quotas but still manage to stay on that bottom rung of society. You complain about the White man whilst taking his hard earned money in benefits. You circlejerk about how inferior Whites are whilst complaining that Whites can't be robots, and essentially admitting us to be superior.

I have nothing but disdain for you, I hope your stay on this Earth ends soon.Yes. My IQ is 280. One time, while on the bus, I glanced over at someone watching “Rick and Morty” for 5 minutes. My IQ jumped many dozens of points just by the mere visuals. However, the audio was way over my head. I will need to study up on this to get on the level of the super-high 400 IQ members of my school who watch Rick and Morty.

20 people from our school graduated early and went to Harvard without taking the SAT. One person took the SAT, but merely wrote “I watch Rick and Morty” on his bubble sheet and essay. He received full marks.

Just by writing the words “Rick and Morty” my IQ has jumped to 300. The intro of the show is now comprehensible. It is now time to write Quora questions about this. How am I to know if I can watch an entire episode with such a low IQ?  wait, wait, wait.... hold your horses... uhm... YOU'RE A GIRL GAMER?!!?! O_O Not to be a freak, but.. just when I thought you couldn't get more attractive.. you started playing video games. Nicely done, m'lady. You've just become every man's dream woman. If you had missed a couple before, now you can be sure you've got us ALL "drooling", lol.
I smoked the pot once. I went absolutely batshit crazy! I couldn't believe it! I found myself driving 2 miles over the speed limit completely safe in my lane to the nearest McDonalds... After ordering my Big Mac, large fries and large Chocolate shake. I safely returned home. I watched some Southpark, ate some amazing munchies, laughed my ass off and slept like a baby....
I woke up the next morning covered in blood and realized my McDs run had been a bad dream. I actually was driving 100 miles an hour. Jumped a curb and killed two homeless people. I proceeded to toss them in my trunk. Brought them home. Chopped them up and ate em... Damn I really went crazy! I'll never smoke the pot again! It's the devils lettuce!What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you fucking kulak? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the The People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Batista's cuban government, and I have over 410757864530 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire USSR armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet you ass munching fascist? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the world and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, whitey. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kulak.

She knows that at 10pm sharp each night, she must be nude and lying face up in our bed. I tie her wrists to the headboard of the bed, and then I slap her face 10 times a minute for 10 minutes. Then, I choke her neck for 60 seconds. As I release her neck and she gasps her air, I deliver a solid punch to her stomach. Then, I use a leather belt to whip her pussy for 5 minutes. And then, without any lubricant other than a bit of saliva, I anally rape her for 60 minutes with my 11-inch erect cock, typically cumming between 3 and 5 times deep inside of her rectum. We do this every night at 10pm, without exception.I find it absolutely disgusting that The Pokemon Company are afraid to come out about not liking Bidoof. First. they exclude him from being in Pokken (yes, we all know he would be op, but it's sickening nonetheless that they wouldn't admit it)

Second, they refuse to give him his own Zelda game. Where's my "Bidoof: Breath of The Wild" Nintendo?

Finally, they refuse to give Bidoof his own Pokemon: Let's go. They're afraid of Bidoof, of all the leverage he has in the pokemon community, and I find it sickening they don't give him the respect he deserves‼️ATTENTION‼️ 💀👻ALL HALLOWEEN🎃🕸 HOES😙💅 ITS TIME TO GET ☠️SPOOKY💀 YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS👏 GET 👊FISTED👊 BY A 💀SKELETON 💀SHOVE✊🍭 CANDY 🌽🌽CORN🍬 IN YOUR👉PUSSY😽 AND 🙅DONT🙅‍♂️ FORGET TO SUCK😩🙌 SOME 💏DRACULA💉 DICK🍆💦😫 SO PUT 🔛 YOUR 👗👑COSTUMES👘👒 AND GO 🚪DOOR TO DOOR🚪 👀👅💦BEGGING😩 FOR THAT 😍GOOD GOOD😍 SEND THIS TO TWELVE1️⃣2️⃣ ☠️SPOOKY👻 🍑SLUTS🌮 TO 👁SHOW💁 THAT YOURE READY TO GET SOME 🍫CHOCOLATE🍫 COVERED 🍆DICK🌽posting a bunch of garbage I did over the course of a couple weeks several years ago to annoy the crap out of some farkers.  Mission accomplished.The word ‘cuck’ gets used a lot lately. Many people have taken a try at describing the phenomenon, but I think all existing descriptions of ‘cuck’ miss why the point and the power of the word. They miss why ‘cuck’ is not merely a modern ‘faggot’ or ‘hippy,’ but actually something much stronger. The perfect description for a modern epidemic that is destroying our nations, our societies, and our souls.

To understand why ‘cuck’ is so powerful, we need to understand its origins and literal meaning. The word cuck is a short for cuckold, which is a man whose wife is cheating on him. More specifically, in modern usage, a cuckold is a man who KNOWINGLY ALLOWS his wife to cheat on him – either because he gains pleasure from it or because he is too weak or cowardly to stop it. But this is not the original source of ‘cuck,’ nor the one that best describes why ‘cuck’ is the perfect description for the modern age.

The term cuckold itself comes from the cuckoo bird: a bird that is a brood parasite. The cuckoo bird lays its eggs in the nests of other birds. Once the egg hatches, the young cuckoo will swiftly destroy or eat most or all of the nest’s original inhabitants. The parents of these murdered young who come back to a nest with a baby cuckoo in it will ignore the carnage, and dutifully raise the young cuckoo as if it is their own chick. Indeed, because cuckoos are often much larger than the birds whose nests they parasitize, it is possible for cucked parents to literally starve as they struggle to provide for the murderer of their real children.

In both cases, human and bird, we have a subject which has utterly abandoned the self-interest of itself and of its kin in the favor of others – often the very others who have wronged them.

You may wonder: why do cucked birds not fight back, or abandon the cuckoo? There are many reasons. Some birds seem to genuinely be unable to tell that the cuckoo is, in fact, not their own. You might think this would be a uniquely avian feature – but see human ‘cucks’ who seem completely unable to differentiate between foreigners and their own kith and kin when deciding who is deserving of aid and alliance.

Other birds are aware of the dangers cuckoo’s pose, and will try to destroy cuckoo eggs and chicks when they find them in their nests. Cuckoo birds have a strategy for dealing with this, however. Although cuckoo birds refuse to raise their own young, they are not above providing some amount of parental protection. When they find that one of their eggs has been removed from a nest they have parasitized, they immediately destroy the entire nest, and attack the smaller parents, often killing them. With such a threat hanging over their heads, it’s little wonder that small birds so strenuously provide for the cuckoo in their midst. And after all, sometimes a young cuckoo might leave one or two of the original brood alive. Imagine those young birds for a moment. Aren’t those young birds lucky to be so culturally enriched as to have a kind cuckoo brother in their nest? And although the cuckoo will take the lion’s share of the food and space in the nest, those other birds really shouldn’t be so selfish. After all, it’s not like cuckoos can build nests of their own!

In this context, it is easy to see just why ‘cuck’ is absolutely appropriate to a certain breed of today’s politicians. A cuck politician is a cuck when he or she takes pleasure in his nation’s people being cheated on. He gains political standing and a sense of moral superiority when he allows poor little cuckoo birds to roost in his nations cities and towns. A cuck politician is also a cuck because he knows that if he were ever to act against the cuckoos in his midst, he would invite disaster. Riots, terrorism, beheadings… And, of course, the approbation of his fellows cucks. Much better, in the mind of the cuck, to appease the cuckoo birds. Sure, a few of his own people might end up devoured or pushed out of the nest. But, better that than to have the nest destroyed entirely, right?

Let’s go back to nature, briefly. You may wonder if birds have any other defenses against the cuckoo menace, or if they are doomed to always raise the offspring of their enemy. In fact, they do. Some species of birds, when they discover an adult cuckoo, will form a swarm and drive the bird away or kill it. For the cuckoo is, though large, ultimately a parasite. The amount of cuckoos in a given area can never grow larger than the number of birds which it parasitizes, for the cuckoo is incapable of raising its own young.

In this context, again, we see a remarkable analogy between the modern situation and the natural world. The cuckoo nations – and let’s not pretend we don’t know who these nations are – are incapable of building their own power, or raising their own strength. The cuckoo nations will never, inside their own borders, build empires and armies and technological wonders which dwarf the rest of the world. The best they can do is to attempt to take these things from others, when they find them. And yet, the cuckoo must rely on stealth and subterfuge most of the time, for it ultimately is weaker than those it parasitizes.

See how the cuckoo operates. When it cannot win by force, it uses subterfuge. ‘Islam is a religion of peace.’ ‘Diversity is strength.’ ‘We are just like you.’ And the cuck believes them, and embraces its own destruction. For once the cuckoo gains strength, and no longer needs the cuckold, it immediately turns on them. The human cuckoos hold own hand out in supplication, while holding in their other hand a machete. Although they could never defeat the West in a straight fight, they do not have to. Merely the threat is sufficient, when a nation is run by cucks.

And our nations ARE run by cucks. Let there be no doubt about it. Cucks in both senses of the word: they refuse to recognize their enemy, and they can great pleasure in siding with him against their own countrymen. You can recognize a cuck through their signatures, ‘All people are the same, we should endeavor to help foreigners just as much as our own people.’ ‘It’s unfair for us to have so much, and them to have so little. Let us take all we have built and give it to those who have built nothing.’ This is the cuckoldry of nations, and is what is meant when a politician is called a ‘cuck.’ Elect a cuck at your peril.

But cuckoldry in the modern world goes far beyond immigration politics. Cuckoldry has become an entire mindset. The modern cuck is not a cuck only in one circumstance, but in ALL circumstances. When the modern cuck has to choose between foreigners and his countrymen, he chooses the foreigners. When the modern cuck has to choose between his race and another, he chooses the other. When the modern male cuck has to choose between men and women, he chooses women. When the modern cuck has to choose between his family and strangers, he chooses strangers. And, (of course!), when the cuck has to choose between himself and a stranger when it comes to fucking his partner, the cuck chooses the stranger!( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ╯╲___卐卐卐卐卐 Don't mind me just taking pewdiepie for a walk

It's being a kid. However, when you start having sex and the words "suck dick" actually becomes something that has a meaning, you'll become aware of what your words actually mean. Building a youth with respect when on the matter of sex, and the limits and expectations of others, start when you develop a way of shaming people, joking, the way you address others and your own limits. It's subconscious. For a woman, the words "suck dick" mean having her face smoshed to man's hairy crotch in a demeaning way - and in rarer cases, freely without pressure as a token of love. In either way, though a joke to you, that isn't what pops up into your mind. I'm not mad at you, but don't joke about what you do not understand. Just be aware that your words have a meaning, because if you don't mean what you say, your words are worthless. Treat your friends with respect, and your future loved one with ever so more of it. I know you meant nothing more than a joke, but once you start having sex, you'll understand it's not all that funny. 😌Calling📞all😫units🚓, shots🔫fired🔥

I want to find a girl who will love me forever. I want her to smother my face with kisses with her amazing lipstick on a daily basis. I want her to let me kiss her vagina for 3 hours straight. I want to cuddle her every single night and have sex with her (condoms of course because children are gay). I want to love her. I want her to love me. I don't want to be lonely. I know I'll find someone someday. If I find nobody, I will honestly kill myself. I want to be loved. If you are a girl between the age of 13 and 69, please send me nudes on my instagram: Racurtis_1022 , my DMs are open to all. Thanks, much appreciated.OwO Pweease twunn off ur adbwock so our weebsite can genwate munnyss

#OVVO HARDCORE ASS FUCKING AND HENTAI TENTACLE PORN BABES IN YOUR AREA LOOKING FOR COCK--# PLEASE FUCKING HELP ME THEY TOOK MY WIFE AND MY KIDS OH GOD PLEASE I DONT KNOW WHERE I AM BUT EVERY HOUR A 600 POUND MAN SMASHES MY RIPE NUTS WITH A HAMMER I like niggers.

The pet store was selling them for 5¢ a piece. I thought that odd since they were normally a couple thousand each. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth. I bought 200. I like niggers.

I took my 200 niggers home. I have a big car. I let one drive. His name was Sigmund. He was retarded. In fact, none of them were really bright. They kept punching themselves in their genitals. I laughed. Then they punched my genitals. I stopped laughing.

I herded them into my room. They didn't adapt very well to their new environment. They would screech, hurl themselves off of the couch at high speeds and slam into the wall. Although humorous at first, the spectacle lost its novelty halfway into its third hour.

Two hours later I found out why all the niggers were so inexpensive: they all died. No apparent reason. They all just sorta' dropped dead. Kinda' like when you buy a goldfish and it dies five hours later. Damn cheap niggers.

I didn't know what to do. There were 200 dead niggers lying all over my room, on the bed, in the dresser, hanging from my bookcase. It looked like I had 200 throw rugs.

I tried to flush one down the toilet. It didn't work. It got stuck. Then I had one dead, wet nigger and 199 dead, dry niggers.

I tried pretending that they were just stuffed animals. That worked for a while, that is until they began to decompose. It started to smell real bad.

I had to pee but there was a dead nigger in the toilet and I didn't want to call the plumber. I was embarrassed.

I tried to slow down the decomposition by freezing them. Unfortunately there was only enough room for two niggers at a time so I had to change them every 30 seconds. I also had to eat all the food in the freezer so it didn't all go bad.

I tried burning them. Little did I know my bed was flammable. I had to extinguish the fire.

Then I had one dead, wet nigger in my toilet, two dead, frozen niggers in my freezer, and 197 dead, charred niggers in a pile on my bed. The odor wasn't improving.

I became agitated at my inability to dispose of my niggers and to use the bathroom. I severely beat one of my niggers. I felt better.

I tried throwing them way but the garbage man said that the city wasn't allowed to dispose of charred primates. I told him that I had a wet one. He couldn't take that one either. I didn't bother asking about the frozen ones.

I finally arrived at a solution. I gave them out as Christmas gifts. My friends didn't know quite what to say. They pretended that they like them but I could tell they were lying. Ingrates. So I punched them in the genitals.

I like niggers.

Look, boom, bam, bop, bada bop, boom, Pow!Has society really become so debased in recent times that we signal our respect to others by typing "F"? How pathetic. That to me doesn't show respect at all, it shows complete lunacy and laziness. I angry react every comment I see with just an F. I do feel that this is part of a wider phenomenon where people don't really understand how to show genuine gratitude and sincere feelings anymore. Essentially, we are more inclined to take people for granted to the extent that we would rather press a single letter on a keyboard to acknowledge what someone has done or said, rather than take some time out to explain why we are grateful. It's ridiculous and this practice should be stopped immediately. No surprises that this practice originates from an internet game - "Call of Duty", where people literally press F for respects. I think this sums up everything succinctly. I don't expect basement-dwellers jacking off furiously whilst simultaneously shooting down grandmas and hoes to know the definition of respect. It is important to show our appreciation for others. Stop being a douchebag and "pressing F". It annoys the hell out of me, and I'm sure people look down on you for engaging in such a practice. I know I certainly get the impression of you acting like that bobbing duck toy (as shown). Are you a reasonable human being or a bobbing duck toy? Ask yourself that. I've got an "F" for you: Fuck off with this nonsense.Listen here bitch I get sex all the time you dont even know little fucking bitch I have like 15 girls on speedial which is crazy cause you can only speed dial up to 9 people with my t9 phone but I still did it bitch I have money going on for days dont make me slap your ass you know that will make your body implode with the sheer force of 15 nukes little fucking bitch how about instead you but some advion shave gell in your dickhole and fucking slip away from here before I take this to the next level and fucking dip your fucking fingers in some fucking sauce bitchhi all

first i must say thank you all for this board so i can keep my son away from nasty stuff the devil puts on this earth

as grateful as i am i am here to tell you all to ban team fortress 2 (abbreviated as TF2) for the following reasons

i discovered about it this weekend when my 15 year old son charlie brought home his friend and they were playing on his friend's laptop a game where it's nothing but killing, bad words, god bashing, anti-american propaganda, and worst of all HOMOSEXUALITY!! they all are posed to look threatening (i guess that's what boys like these days)

there is also blantent homosexuality (when the doctor heals his patients they all say things like "i love this doctor" or "get behind me doctor!")

they made a character that looks like a soldier and he talks about god's world being his ("this is my world, you are not welcome in my world!") when i heard this i was MORBIDLY SHOCKED and appalled and ashamed of my son and he knew it

i was wondering why my son was getting into fights and after i saw this i banned him from ever seeing his friends

if you see your child playing this, tell them to uninstall it and watch him do it!!!

hope this helps parents out so your child doesn't stray far from god!

I don't know, I used to take part in the countless secret raids of my  "Navy fleet of Al Qaeda, " More than 300 confirmed that he killed people. I was trained in the Gorilla Wars and even had an American army sniper. Yes, but only for other purposes. I've never seen this world, exact, my word. You think this thing can surf the internet? I thought anew. I've contacted my mystery, spies, United States, now that we have a better storm, ready for maggots. A storm that wiped away life. You and my girlfriend have sex with me anytime, anywhere, and I can kill you in 700 ways, it's just in his hands. The formation of martial arts skills is easy, but in the arsenal of the American navy, I use it to remove the unfortunate group of donkeys. If you know that you are ready to pay a little bit of a  "smart " comment, you might start looking for him and follow the fall. But no, it's soup, you fool. Rage, the whole world goes to hell and sinks. You slept with my girlfriend.
Why doesn't America just legalise mass shootings?

Firstly, it's a distinctive point of national and cultural identity. Mass shootings are an iconic event in the USA. We can say "there was a mass shooting today" and you already know with reasonable certainty which nation it happened in. It's comparable to saying "someone was beheaded yesterday"; to say which region it occurred in is essentially redundant due to it being a proud allusive icon of the geographic area. Like poor education and glorified obesity, it would be delusional to pretend mass shootings are not a unique figure of national heritage to stand out among other Western nations. As such, it should be legalised or at least decriminalised in order to preserve this cultural tradition.

Secondly, due to the criminal nature of the act and the large jail terms attached to it, most perpetrators end up committing suicide after partaking in the shooting. It is clear from the past statistics that criminal punishment will not prevent this crime, but will instead lead to increased suicide rates and compound the already disturbing incarceration rate in the "land of the free". Both these figures can be mediated through the decriminalisation of mass killings.

Finally, it seems as if the act of a mass shooting is, in a perverse sense, a symbol of unity and bonding that can provide common ground for the traditionally severe dichotomy of Christianity and Islam. Through the extremist acts of killing innocent peoples committed by both these groups, the American people may finally come to realise that the true issue is not which merciless, jealous God you worship, but rather how much of a delusional schizophrenic you are. This moment of epiphany has the power to break down traditional barriers and allow you, as a nation, to advance to the first world and begin considering more important issues.

It just seems as if legalising mass shootings is the right thing to do.

During the previews, she gradually leans into my shoulder. I put my arm around her as she snuggles up to my chest. Movie ends. I take her home, it's like 1 in the morning so she invites me to stay the night. I sit on the couch and turn on the TV. She sits next to me again, like at the movie theater, and lays her head in my lap. She tells me that she's just gonna take a little rest. I start running my fingers through her long, straight, black hair. She starts to doze off. I wait half an hour or so until she is fully passed out. Once I know she is out, I carry her bridal style up to her room, lay her down on her bed, and tuck her in with the covers pulled right up to her chin. I then go back down stairs, and fall asleep on the couch, like a true gentleman.🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴

🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴⚪⚪⚪🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴[removed]I did the math and research. According to Wikipedia, the average length of a penis varies from 5.1 to 5.9 inches. I went for a safe 5.5 inches for an average. The average radius from the core center of the penis to the skin on the outside is .75 inches. From this we can roughly find the volume with pi timed radius squared times height. This comes around as the average penis being around 9.72 cubic inchesNext I found the volume of the average human adult male. I had to first find the weight, which according to Alex Schlessingerman's "The Physics Factbook" is 70kg or 154 pounds. Weight is found by multiplying an object mass by the force of gravity, 9.81 meters per second. After taking gravity out of the equation, the average mass of an adult human male is 7.14 kg. I then found the volume by dividing this number by the average density of a human, according to Wikipedia, 985 kg per meter cubed. The volume of the adult male was then found to be .0072516316 cubic meters. Utilizing the volume of the average penis I found earlier, 9.72 in cubed, I get .0001592828 meters cubed. This means the penis is 2.19% of an adult male's volume.Assuming a lack of testosterone or female hormones makes the person a female, balls ignored for ease, fucking a trap is only 2.19% homosexual.I remember the first time I learned people were retarded chimpanzees.. I started reading a book when I was 11 called the tipping point by malcom gladwell.. good book, some anecdotes on psychology, some interesting sociological stats. I was reading In math class, because who needs simple algebra when you can do quantum physics and college level computing when you're 12. A girl asked me what I was reading, so I showed her and her knee jerk reaction was that "oh there's a number in that book with a percent, I can't read it. I went home and did some IQ research and found out that my iq was over 400, and I did the standard deviation math and realized that if the average human's processing power is 93 in this country, and a cockroaches processing power is 25ish, that the average human has a lot more in common with a cockroach than they do with me.❗️⚠️WARNING⚠️❗️

Sometimes I ask myself why do beautiful women such as yourself go around flaunting themselves when they could find a nice guy? Now I must bid you adieu.Reddit has truly become quite lazy in nature. One worded posts are truly quite a disgrace. I'm sure for you, you just see it as easy karma - you come on every week or so and just think about how to contribute in the laziest way possible. I hate how in reddit it seems that some of the laziest, shortest comments seem to get upvoted and I truly believe it is a disgrace and shows that we are in darker days as a website. We almost lost ourself during the Pao debacle, we almost lost ourselves before that but Reddit just continues to grow stronger. I'm starting to believe it's just similar to facebook - too big to fall.

So as you guys may know, being alive requires breathing the atmosphere, which is approximately 78.084% Nitrogen, 20.946% Oxygen, 0.9340% Argon etc. There's a lot of other things including the vapor of whatever liquids you're around at the moment. Now, to get to the point, every man that ever ejaculated has traces of sperm in his penis, sperm is a liquid which means it evaporates all the time and escapes into the atmosphere. That means that by breathing you're swallowing sperm, and that's gay.Does anyone get randomly turned on by little pump.

-----------------------------
Who Am I?
Well, it is all on my profile but I'll restate it here. I am a fifteen year old student living in San Jose, California. I am decently smart and do competition math and computer science. I enjoy Ultimate, running, breakdance, and being in the outdoors. I am currently delving deeper into some more advanced algorithms and expanding my computer science knowledge. I attend hackathons and do some Android development, specifically in the rooting sector.

What Are My Credentials?
Many of you may already be looking down on me with scorn. "This guy is only 15 years old! Who the hell does he think he is, trying to preach to us as if he was some elite god?"
Well, it is true I am quite young. However, I am fortunate enough to live in what is probably the best place for students in the whole world: Silicon Valley. Yup, that magical place in California where Apple, Facebook, and Google were founded and all those amazing new technologies are invented. Here, new companies are created every single day. (In fact, that may not be an exaggeration) The people and environment around me is amazing. For example, students and people I know are setting up TedX at their respective schools, inviting a friend that happens to be a Tesla co-founder to give a talk (This is a student and a great friend of mine), attending hackathons every month where students are encouraged to 'hack' and create new and innovative projects(and prizes are handed out, as well as scholarships and other free sponsor stuff), and it being strange when we don't have some national finalist in areas such as business, STEM, competition math, engineering, etc. Probably the best public school in all of the USA. The atmosphere, type of parents, teachers, and community we have are simply so dedicated that it is amazing. 4.0 is practically given. The environment here simply churns out successful entrepreneurs, businessmen, and thinkers. So I get to experience all these innovative people, be one of these people who are doing things that grown-ups or college students do, and everything is just so advanced here. Everyone does extra stuff, everyone has amazing background, etc. Repigyou, for example, goes to a school a few minutes away from mine and he quit Minecraft because he got a few bad grades in freshman year, which many might say doesn't matter because colleges don't look at that. Very ignorant mindset. Anyways, this might not have happened in other areas.

In my opinion, this is a sharp contrast to most of you folks. In Mexico, Hong Kong, and other places in America, school is probably all that students have to do. You aren't pushed to do more, a couple of B's and maybe a C is fine. (Keep in mind this is general. In Korea for example I know the education standards are extremely high, due to the format of the College applications process) So I'm saying that many of you guys live in normal, ordinary schools where you aren't pressured to study and if you are it's only to get good grades in school, which is still not easy for some and can delude you into thinking that you're doing something. Perhaps you feel you are involved because you are in some clubs and your parents have encouraged participating in a club sport. Or perhaps you are depresed because Minecraft is taking over your life. Whatever. My point is that unless you are Apple, Plastix, Khazhyk, or somebody who's in a good Ivy college and still apparently plays on Overcast, you will find that I have a stronger background and experiences to be able to talk about this topic of studying, dedication, and life with certainty and conviction.

But it's not all fun and games here. It's very stressful for some people. Sometimes I envy you careless gamers who don't have to worry about life.

Actually, I don't. I'm happy I have this opportunity to live here. You should all envy me.

So What is the Point of this Thread?
Yes, we're getting to that. And as a note, what I say is really only applying to the players who've been on this server for double digit days. The donators, the people in teams, the people that are obsessed. Don't worry about this if you are very active in real life , which I'm sure many of you are. But still read this, hopefully you can learn something.
The people this doesn't apply to are the noobs that get rotated out every month that are used to raise your KD to 1.0. Or the hacker noobs that stack up on the ban list, making the several thousand pages or however many pages there are.

I recently found some depression threads on oc.tc, and I never actually totally realized what type of people were on this server. Now I know that this place is filled with young and immature kids, in addition to the diseased, homeschooled, depressed, and normal kids. For example, people that spend all day on mumble wasting time playing porn for the other immature players to laugh at..(Not pointing fingers at all, please don't be offended, I still respect you. This example just helps to prove my point) Really. I had always thought that I was only playing with kids that even if they were young, were mature and had control over their lives and gaming. But still, there are a couple of specific cases I want to address.

The most basic case. This was me for the past two months or so, and in my guess 50% or so of the really good players on this server: You are a normal or dedicated student, but Minecraft has taken over your life. Your grades are suffering, but you and your parents don't really care. You have stopped playing sports and ditch track practice every day. You play until morning, and finally sleep when you ask yourself exactly what you are accomplishing by ruining your eyes and sleep quality. Finally, you go to sleep and wake up on the same day, eyes burning in the morning and vision foggy. You tell yourself that you will never ocktick again, and finish your homework at school, finishing each classes' homework in the class right before. Sometimes you are unable to. (I always did, as I am BS and clutch master. And got full score. And my grades didn't suffer. But my eyes and self-esteem did.) You come back in the afternoon, find that your mom is not home and clock a couple of hours before dinner. You tell yourself you will work later, but find yourself playing Minecraft again. This vicious cycle repeats over and over. To aid in your slump, you download and tweak some programs so you can hotkey and hide Minecraft from your taskbar and screen. These people know Minecraft is bad for them. But they can't tear themselves away from farming a couple of more monuments on Primed or wrecking noobs on Conquer.

Then the minority case. You are bullied or depressed from real life problems. Perhaps you are antisocial and unable to make real friends. You are immature and get depressed about yourself because your 'crush' is in a 'relationship' with another person. You find yourself disappointed with yourself and the current state of affairs. Perhaps you are diseased. You turn to Minecraft for comfort and friends and to lose yourself and forget all your fears, expectations, and homework. You find that friendships online are easier to maintain. Eventually the only thing you look forward to is Minecraft and it becomes your life.

And these are the problems I would like to address, and hopefully provide some valuable tips, advice, and insight to help anyone that might be in this situation. I want this to be a wake up call for you guys.

Great, So What Can I Do to Help Myself?
Okay, I have a lot of information for you guys. I'm going to try to organize it as best as possible, but please don't be disappointed if it's not so clear. I'll do my best, and please try your hardest to stay with me. I'll provide a brief summary at the end as well.
Step 1: Finding an Interest
The first step in getting out of this slump is to set a goal. Without a goal, you're just a sad looking Magikarp floundering around. If you don't have a goal of becoming a elite Lvl. 100 Magikarp or a sexy Gyrados , you're not going to get anywhere in life. So this first step is finding what interests you. This could be anything, from art to design to computer science to biology to law to business to e-commerce to networking to engineering to fashion design.

A common answer I've gotten from my ocktick buddies to this question is 'gaming'. Now. Guys. Galls, girls, folks, buddies, homies, niggas, besties, strangers. Listen! 'Gaming' is not an answer choice for this question! Games are flipping made to appeal to people. They accomplish absolutely nothing but merely provide enjoyment. Like drugs. I know most of you fantasize about getting rich off a youtube channel, but this is very unrealistic. 99.9999% of you need to stop thinking that this is an interest. Gaming is a time-waster. The only purpose should be to help de-stress, there when you need a break and need to forget about life for a short while. It is not something that is going to turn into a career. So get that mindset out of your heads this instant. And you will have an interest, trust me. The only reason you don't have one right now is because you've been wasting all of your time ockticking! So how do you find an interest?

I encourage you to take some time to just surf the web. If you're interested in technology, go to popular tech websites such as the Verge or similar sites and just read about current technology. Find something that seems cool, or interesting. Anything that strikes out at you as potentially interesting, learn more about it! If you are interested in what rooting does to an Android phone, google it. Try rooting your android.(Actually, don't if you don't know what you're doing) If you think 3D printing is amazing, learn more about it. To find an interest, you really just need to spend time out on the web surfing, researching, becoming interested. I don't know. Bioengineering?

Step Two: The Inevitable
Now that you've found an interest, you need to be able to spend some time learning about it. And that means steering away from Minecraft a bit. I know you're all fearing this, but it must be done. You don't have to quit, but you should definitely cut down on the time you spend gaming. You have to. It's not a suggestion. Go do it. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, uninstall Minecraft and all the related mods, texture packs, recording programs, etc.

I can't tell you how to play a game less. But the main things:

If you've realized that Minecraft has a negative impact on your life, step away from it. Try leaving it for three days. Or restrict yourself to 1 hour a day for a week. See what happens. Enjoy the fact that your head doesn't fall back in class every ten seconds in the morning. Enjoy the fact that your eyes aren't blurry or painful in the morning. There will be so many immediate improvements in physical health, as well as mental health. You will immediately feel more purposeful and energetic. Once you've commited to this, it should be easy because you know it is for your own good, and you see instant results!

For others, however, this step may be difficult. But there are other things that will actually cause you to spend less time playing because you're so busy! I'll discuss those things later.

You need to overcome a certain threshold of understanding for this step. It will be different for everyone. You need to realize that stepping away from Minecraft is a good thing. You might suffer. But you need to push through and simply PLAY LESS. There is no simple way to do this one. Good luck.

Step Three: General Life Tips
This step is not really a step. These tips are just here to improve your life. Read on!

Blue Light Filters!!! Something really important! Blue light filter and reducing screen brightness! So in a nutshell, blue light is really bad for your eyes. The LED stuff. It will ruin your eyes multiple times faster than other light, and sadly this is what is used in AMOLED screens and LCD. Basically all screens such as computers, TV, and phones. LED is simply very bright artifical light. As in, when you look at it late at night, it tires your eyes and disrupts your sleep patterns, as you are only supposed to experience bright light during the day.

Getting a blue light filter such as f.lux brings the screen closer to natural, room light. This is so much better than killing your eyes with LED 24/7. Ideally, the computer screen is barely brighter than room brightness, to minimize strain on your eyes. Actually, the most ideal would be less bright than room, but that is not realistic.

Also, never use screens in the dark. Anything in the dark is too bright because there is no room brightness to counter it, so your eyes are basically getting wrecked no matter how low you put the brightness.

The colors are more yellow-reddish and more washed out, but you get used to it. Currently, when I disable blue light filter I can really tell a huge difference and too much blue light is extremely uncomfortable, as my eyes are not accustomed to such unhealthy screens now. Minecraft without the filter seems way too bright and over-emphasized, and it strains my eyes. Which is not me having weak eyes, it's my eyes not being used to such lethal screens. Which is good. Trust me and try using the filter for a week straight without turning it off. You will see improvements in sleep and eye condition.

Get some Good Music! Okay, you can group music into several groups. I'm not going to pretend I'm a music expert but hopefully I can suggest some good producers at the very least. The music I have is some party music, because everyone's got to have that when you're with groups, electronic music, and inspirational music.

You listen to hardcore, dubstep electronic music when you game or work out. Like Monstercat if you're weird like dukman or biixerv. Nightcore and some Tobu if you're me. It turns you on and your body just enters a high-activity state. Or rap music is fine for these purposes as well, which I prefer.

You listen to inspirational music when you need inspiration. This is like people singing... Simple electronic can't really touch chords such as words do with humans. Some mainstream inspirational music I have is We Are the Champions (Queen) and You Raise Me Up (Martin). I was listening to one when I finally decided I would write this for my ocktick buddies.

I also have peaceful electro music such as Kygo, which is for when I am doing homework or taking a break. Calms you down. Check him out, he's an amazing producer. I've bolded his name for a reason.

And I have Buddhist mantras for when I'm feeling overly religious and need that dose of mindfulness and insight. For any of you atheists out there, I reccomend Buddhism. I could probably write a whole 'nother page on how Christianity has ruined Koreans in my community and Buddhism actually is proved in real life and is not a flipping worship of Buddha. Buddha was the first person to achieve enlightenment, a state of true insight. You have probably all experienced flashes of it, like when you unclouded the mystery behind something,(solved that elegant math problem, finally realized WHY something happened) you felt that ephemeral, raw beauty. Enlightenment is not some bullshit state of godly being, it is just pretty much constantly having that feeling. And we are followers, and he merely offers us guidance. We are not worshipping him like Christians worship God as the creator of this earth. And you know when you're all like thanking God for trivial stuff.. And then you look over at Africa and really that's 'God's doing' as well... Some God. Anyways. Don't want to get controversial here. Skype me for more. Check out the book "Outliers" by Malcolm Gladwell for a good read and good content. It has a lot of mind-blowing and thoughtful content. Anyways. Back to the main topic.

Exercise! Exercise can have different purposes, but this is a vital aspect in ensuring that you are a well rounded Homo sapiens. Just like music, exercise touches off important chords in humans. And if you don't like sports, that's simply because you haven't explored enough. And if you're weak, even more reason for you to get out and do some sports. Even if you're fat or a twig. I really cannot emphasize how important sports and physical activity are for the human.

Some not-so-considered sports that you might not have considered?

Badminton. This is not sissy tennis, boys. It is definitely easier to play than tennis but still has the same dedication and skill required at higher levels. Fun and entertaining for both gender and all ages.

Ultimate frisbee. This is not a sissy sport, kids. This is more tiring than tennis, volleyball, basketball, or any other 'legit' sport you play. You're constantly cutting to get open, or staying on the right side of your man. It encourages co-ed playing, and has a lot of strategy involved. Definitely more strategy than sports like soccer or tennis, which I've both played at a competitive club level. If you think it is a toss-and-go, easy-money game, learn about Horizontal Stack, Zone, handler movements, dead disc plays and come back. But it is very easy to pick up, as all you need to do is be able to run and throw. And all you need is a disc and some open space! Very entertaining, and google AUDL matches if you're interested.

Working out. This improves confidence, makes you stronger, and is just helpful to your health and well-being. I have started doing this recently, and contrary to popular misconceptions, you don't need to go to a gym or be a buff guy to do it. You get buff from doing it, not you do it because you're buff. This is most realistic for anybody from a twig up to a bit overweight person. All you need is bars and motivation. Also if you're young, lifting weights is actually bad. Stops bone growth by crushing your growing muscles. Calisthenics, or bar workouts, is what I'm recommending, and you can still get insanely buff... Check out the Bar Brothers. Anyways, Someone I know was 98 pounds at 16 years and put on 20 in a month. 20 more in the next two with simply bars and eggs, nothing else. I'm no expert, but you need to work till you physically can't do another set. And buff up on protein such as milk, eggs, meat, etc to fill up the muscle tears you get from working out. Do a lot of dips and pull ups if you want big arms. ;) And work out every two days, for usually half an hour or until you're muscles have enlarged to twice their size and you can't control them very well. It's not a big time commitment at all. Here's a link to an inspirational Quora article for y'all about this guy that bounced back from gaming and disease to become an amazing person: Click on this link for an inspirational article!>

You Can't Make Good Food out of Bad Ingredients Stop eating junk food. Often times I hear people say they will go out for Jamba Juice or something before their workout. When I ask why, they reply that they'll burn it off anyways. Now that's just stupid. Health does not consist of two variables, fat level and work level. Unhealthy is not the same as fat. You need to understand that even if you don't see immediate negative results, junk food is bad for you.

I don't know to what extent this may seem weird to you, but if my friends offer me chips or a cookie, I always decline. If I'm offered food by my mom at around 3, I usually refuse. You folks need to understand the benefit of good eating habits. They are vital to your health, wellbeing, and happiness. Have you ever seen girls who drink Boba every day as they go into high school? Or try too hard to impress? Their aura, their faces, suffer. They just have a more negative, less natural, less attractive face.

Food is what your body uses to build itself.
If you give yourself bad food you will become a 'bad' person. Just eat healthy, eat greens always. And get a lot of protein. Have a balanced diet, and eat good food. But you don't have to deprive yourself of sweets. I enjoy eating cereal and blueberry pie and baked treats every now and then, which in my opinion taste much better than the artificial junk most eat nowadays. I don't eat any junk food, because I actually think it tastes bad. And I'd like to propose to you what's known as intermittent fasting. In a nutshell, if we eat when our tank is full, the excess becomes fat. Simple. So you group your food intake . You eat 3 big meals a day, giving your body time to use all the energy. For adults, you usually take a break from a meal about three times a week. This is a very effective and healthy way to burn fat, as you're not starving yourself or using pills, and just burning fat naturally. If you're really interested, google it. Just know that how you eat is just as important as what you eat. Don't always be stuffing yourself with small snacks throughout the day to keep up your metabolism, because that's ignorant BS that will just keep your excess energy spilling over into fat. Eat balanced, and keep to 3 meals a day. If you're going to eat some unhealthy food, eat that soon after the meal, to keep your meals grouped.
Now, the meat of this article: The Inspiration
Now that you've found an interest, and successfully stepped away from Minecraft a bit, you need to be inspired to study...

Let me tell you guys something. In life there are geniuses, and normal people. Geniuses are mutants. Their IQ is over 155, their brains are wired differently. They'll work out everything in their heads and spit out an answer that normal people can not comprehend. Geniuses can visualize multi variable calculus, and visibly see the changes that occur when you add in another equation. Socrates is a good example. In debates, in his head he would predict what the response would be to his answer, and then the next, and the next, and so arrive at the final conclusion before it occurred. Try googling it if you're interested.

Now, everything comes easily to geniuses. They can skim through a book and understand 80 percent. Then they have to try for the rest of the 20. Normal people understand 5 percent, and then they have to try for the rest of the 95. It's not fair, but life is not fair.

But many geniuses are homeless drug addicts. Since everything comes so easily they never work or do anything with their talent and their lives are ruined. However, when geniuses try that's when you get people like Einstein or Socrates. Their work is studied for centuries after as people attempt to understand why they said what they did.

Now the rest of the people learn that they must work to understand things. And that's how it is for most people. Even if you're a little bit smarter than the person next to you, that person will succeed if they try harder. It's as simple as that. The more you work, the more you will succeed. There's nothing to it. If you want to be smart, you have to be prepared to lose sleep studying. The genius that works hard will always win. But between the genius and the diligent worker, the diligent worker will always come out on top.

One of my Korean adult 'buddies' came from Korea as a kid. The education here was so different, so much more encouraging than Korea. But he struggled, as he didn't know any English. Anyways, he set his sights on Harvard Law School (Arguably the best law school in the USA) and became zealously dedicated. He didn't sleep, he worked his butt off day and night. He ended up putting in ONLY ONE college application. That is insane. Psychopathic. And guess what? He got in.

You ask me, what if he didn't get in? Then it would be over. It was a leap of faith. If he hadn't gotten in, as my man Rise likes to say, bleach would have been the answer. But the thing is that is how dedicated you need to be if you want to be that sure of your success. How much dedication do you think it required to be able to only put in one app like that?

I don't know what you are all feeling. Maybe annoyed that your mom is pressuring you to study and it's annoying as hell. But when high school sophomore year rolls around, and you're starting to get worried, it will be too late for many of you. All those other kids you're competing with, the serious ones, have already put in thousands of hours. You need to start right now. If you don't want to look back at your life once you're in college and have regret, regret that you're going to the number one party college where it's literally impossible to work as girls in bikinis rollerblade outside your college classroom, regret that you go to a college where the new law allowing mobile homes to stay on campus has led to 500% increase in drug dealings, you need to start studying. You're deluding yourself if you think you're going to succeed somehow, or that you're going to be satisfied with mediocre. You need to get out there and make something happen.

And I'll tell you right now, school is not enough. To put it simply, school is just something you have to do. The bare minimum. Everyone does it. You took a couple of harder classes and got a 4.0? Great. Nobody cares. What will really help you get into a college and help you enjoy life and get a good job and so on and so forth is having passion for what you do. (And also soft skills, which you will never develop by staying home playing games anyways.) And don't worry if you are scared about locking yourself into a field of study this early. The fact that you're taking anything seriously and with maturity shows that you have diligence. Many people change majors in college, they change in their junior year even. And they succeed. You know how the 2 years of Spanish in middle school equates to 1 year in high school. That's 1 semester in college. You're not locking yourself in. You need to learn how to work and set yourself up to be successful in the future. And if you end up enjoying and spending the rest of your life doing what you're doing in high school, even better! More time to practice. More hours put in. That's what's really important.

The question you need to ask yourself, is "How bad do you want it?"

Do you or do you not want to be satisfied and successful the rest of your life. Don't think you can make up everything in junior year of high school or magically turn your life around in college. That will be much more difficult. You need to start right now. Stop fooling around. You know how everyone says that getting into a good college doesn't matter, grades don't matter, etc. Trust me. That's important. It's not everything, but it is a huge advantage. The type of people, atmosphere, and what they teach you using the material is different. Do you really want to go to some shit college and work for those Harvard people in the future? Capitalist slavery. Is that appealing to you?

The answer is very simple. Hard work = success.

So get to work kiddos.

Extra Stuff for Homeschooled/Miscellaneous Tips
For the homeschooled, I'm not educated in your situations and context so I can't say much, and I'm not sure how college works for you guys. According to Pugsley, there should still be a lot of clubs and activities in your area that are unrelated to school that you can still find. Which you should.
There's something I've observed. It's that when I find I'm distracted from homework with my phone, I'll usually put it away and think that the problem is is solved. An hour later, I'll still have made no progress on my homework. That's because if you're not focused, no matter what you do, you'll always be distracted and unable to finish your work. That's why all my steps are necessary. You not only need to step away from Minecraft, you also need to inspire yourself. If you don't accomplish the latter, you might as well go back to Minecraft. Because you won't accomplish anything anyways. So delete the facebook app, quit skype, don't go on reddit or whatever time-wasting sites you go to, stop going on youtube and watching pro ladder drops and wool caps, and focus. Music helps. But you have to be inspired. Simply deleting PAD or Trivia Crack from your phone or uninstalling Minecraft and LOL is most likely not going to magically make you focus on your work and succeed.

Maybe you're finding it difficult to become more involved. As well as learning more about your interest on your own and studying, you need to become involved in activities. This is really important in widening your contacts network and being exposed to more opportunities such as internships or events. Again, I don't know about all of your lives and the situations about people in different parts of the USA or the world. But go to competitions, meet more people, ask and get emails. Learn about other events. Consult your teachers that are most involved with extracurricular things at school. Attend camps or sessions or competitions. I can't tell you the specifics, but you need to get out and actively try if you want to extend your network outside of your little school bubble. That is really important. Use google to find events near you! Don't stop searching. Don't think that somehow opportunities will come to you because you deserve it. You need to reach out and contact people yourself. But remember, you can only use these events and contacts to their full capability if you have knowledge in the area. That's why your personal studies are just as important as reaching out. Trust me:

Nothing's fun unless you're good at it.

It's not going to be easy. Being inspired to study and actually studying are completely different things. Often times you may be pressured to just give up your 'pointless' studying and come loose yourself in Minecraft. Don't do it. You have to stay dedicated.

In a Nutshell:
I wanted to wrap up everything I've said:
Step 1: Find an interest.

Step 2: Step away from overcast and Minecraft in general.

Step 3: Become inspired and dedicated. Learn that there is purpose behind your studies.

Step 4: Get to work. Work till you drop. Study your butt off.

Step 5(Optional): Follow SilentBuddha's exceptionally wise Life Tips to become a better person.

Step 6:(Optional): Quit Minecraft forever.

Step 7: Reply on the forum post if this has helped, and share your stories.

Wrap up, and about me.
So some of you may be wondering by now, and can see from my profile, that I've ranked up a decent amount of playing time on this server. Is this guy even practicing what he's preaching? What a hypocrite!
Well, recently I had a wake up call from my good Korean adult mentors/buddies. (It was indirect, they don't even know I play the game. My parents don't know either. I was just inspired) But before that, my friends criticized me. But I played on. I was ignorant and stupid. And perhaps it was easier to step away from Minecraft because it was difficult keeping it secret and having my parents pressure me about my work. It will be more difficult for you because your parents don't care that you game. But if you have parents that care, they will be so proud and impressed at your changes. But that's only if you change. Stop dreaming and start doing.

But I'm glad that I got to see the light before things got worse. I decided that I wouldn't let Minecraft ruin my life, and luckily I wasn't as deeply rooted as some of you are and stepping away from Minecraft a bit is really easy.

However, I've always wanted to help my fellow Minecrafters. I reached out to some people on my team and tried to initiate the first step of finding interest, and the only person that listened to anything I've said is Biixerv, I guess. Creds to that guy. He's really cool, people. Never let biases, first impressions, or anything affect you. You have to stay positive and always try to maintain good relationships with people. Once people see your true nature, you can convert them. You can make anyone a good friend of yours through kindness, respect, and compassion. Don't be an asshole or a jerk. But remember that people like me aren't stupid. When my attempts fail, I can be a real asshole. I have been. But hopefully that never has to happen with you guys.

I changed two people that bullied me. (I wasn't affected at all, don't worry peeps. AKA Their attempts FAILED MISERABLY) One leaves me alone, and is a lot more subdued now. The other is a really good friend of mine now. We're hella chill. And he's much nicer to everybody in life now. I haven't seen any truly mean actions from him since two years ago. Stuff like that makes me truly happy.

I've met some great people, and apply everything in my profile to real life, always staying positive and cheerful but serious enough so that I am taken seriously. And I've met a lot of jerks in real life. Recently a lot of my closest friends I'm having doubts about. Currently only one candidate is in my 'true friends' list, and I don't even know her that well. My other best friends would have to be two Korean adults, who have helped me so much. And they're not benevolent, kind people. They're rough. They're brutally honest. But inside, they're the kindest people ever. Their personalities and mindsets have rubbed off on me. They've brought me above everyone else I know that is my age. In a good way. And they've made me into a new person, someone who wants to give back, and will help if you reach out. But you'll never know. They're scary on the outside. And they changed my inner personality. On the outside, I'm usually over-cheerful and very immature, although that's changed recently due to my friends and just aging. But inside I've become more like them. The people who you choose to associate yourself with is important, people. People this age are mostly all immature on the inside, even if they seem adult-like. Unless you guys meet people like my Korean friends in real life, you will probably be that way as well. I really don't know why I'm saying this... It feels necessary to tell you where this post is coming from. Sorry if it's awkward. I'm just typing what's coming into my mind.

I've got a lot of philosophic stuff that I've thought about and if you have any questions or are curious feel free to ask me on skype. About friends, studying, attitude, dedication and diligence in any academic area... How to approach life and problems... The affect of school and education on friendship, ethics and the morals in mini Cold Wars that happen in your schools... Feel free to hit me up if you need inspiration. Or want to talk. I'm here and I want to help you all!

Hopefully this post helped you. I took a solid couple of hours to write this for you guys. I'd like to hear any stories or reports back if this has helped. Share your stories! They will teach me and everybody else something.

As for Overcast, I'm not really sure what is going to happen. I'm not sure if I'll be able to cut myself off so suddenly. But I'm definitely going to be playing less. I have goals, people. Educational, social, and personal goals. And Minecraft is not helping me achieve those.

I already know that many of you will just brush this off. Please don't. Others will be inspired but they won't actively follow this guide. You have to stay inspired. But that's your job. I'm not your life counselor. Be thankful I'm here helping you. I assure you that you won't get this type of advice in your life. In the rare case that you do, it will most likely be too late. I'm doing you people a favor because I want to help you. And I've still got fuel for y'all! Ask me on skype if you'd like to learn more.

And even if this doesn't do anything to help your lives, at least try to be mature people and stay courteous and respectful in-game and in mumble. I hear stories about completely unacceptable responses in mumble. Don't be a jerk. You're only bringing yourself bad reputation and discouraging others to contribute to making this server better, as well as making it worse yourself.

And lastly, I really have no idea what to expect from Overcast community. I've never done something like this before and I'm not sure whether my 50 percent estimate was correct. Maybe all of you are much smarter and involved than me and I'm just psychopathic. Who knows.

Anyways, thanks everybody. Hope this helped and best of luck in your lives!I sexually Identify as a completely normal male. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of being completely normal GOD DAMNIT. People say to me that a person being a sane cis person on tumblr is Impossible but I don’t care, I’m sane. I’m having a plastic surgeon install ABSOLUTELY NOTHING on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me “David” and respect my right to be completely normal. If you can’t accept me you’re a liberal trash and need to check your sanity levels. Thank you for being so understanding.I'm CummyBot2000 and I love to be fucked for upvotes👏🏾.HEY👏🏾.LOOK👏🏾.I👏🏾.PUT👏🏾.THE👏🏾.HAND👏🏾.EMOJI👏🏾.BETWEEN👏🏾.EVERY👏🏾.WORD👏🏾.GIVE👏🏾.ME👏🏾.KARMA👏🏾.We found this new site called CSGO Lotto—so I'll link it down in the description if you guys want to check it out. We were betting on it today and I won a pot of like $69 or something like that, so it was a pretty small pot, but it was like the coolest feeling ever. I ended up following them on Twitter and stuff, and they hit me up and they're talking to me about potentially doing like a skin sponsorship.You abhorrent scum. *You ignorant fool.* I will sue you. You are going to be the target of the biggest lawsuit in the history of the world. You don't know why? It's completely obvious. It's so obvious, *a dumb drunk baby higher than a weather balloon would understand how wicked and treacherous your actions are with* **polished diamond crystal with 30/30 vision-clear thinking.** Your actions cry out for mercy, and I will be happy to deliver it.
And if you're thinking this is a mistake, or that I made this up, just stop. I have had indisputable proof of your continued harassment and other offenses. Even without it, the jury would take one look at you and decide. The incomprehensible magnitude of your crimes brings with it unavoidable, infinite guilt, whether you notice it or not-but everyone else does. Are you interested in who will be serving as the offense attorney? I'll tell you. It's my father. Your defense? It doesn't matter--in fact, they might just not give you one to spare *one* individual from the trauma. My dad is the greatest lawyer in the US, the world, and human history, including the future. He knows the last one because he *sued the future and they went back in time to tell him.*  He's served for hundreds of Supreme Court cases, and he's one every single one. You may have never thought about being court-mashalled, but but with my dad, that's a real threat. You will lose this case, your money, and your life. Does that scare you, insignificant bug? Because it should. The entire history of the U.S. Judicial System has been leading up to this moment, where all of its fury is concentrated on ruining your life. My father won't even need to help. Your heinous crimes will be evident to all, so just give up, you crook. Give up before you're forced to.⠀⠀⠀⠀⣠⣦⣤⣀

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈  Ever since I was six years old I've been jacking it to Johnny Test. When I was eleven I found my first Johnny Test hentai on my mom's computer. I beat my prebuscent dick so hard that night that I had to go to the ER for stiches. My mom found out and took away all of my Johnny Test carboard cut outs that I had glued 19 inch long didlos to. Every night I watch Johnny Test and beat my meat so hard the skin peels away. I have a Johnny Test figurine in my room that I have cum on everyday since I was just thirteen. I am testsexual and this is my story.Year 257,834 of No Fap:
My brain has grown to gargantuan size and is now about the size of a bowling ball.I am now able to see into the future where I will rule over all of humanity as a deity. My cognitive capacity has eclipsed that of Albert Einstein by one hundred million megafaggots. However, due to the fact that my brain is still growing, my muscle tissue is rapidly deteriorating as my muscle tissues are transforming into brain cells to support my immense intelligence and as a result, I will soon be reduced to a vegetative state where I will be able to warp space time through my new knowledge of quantum physics. My knowledge of astrophysics has rocketed one million years ahead of anyone on the planet. Through this new knowledge, I unlocked the ability to warp gravity.  With this new ability I was able to rip a hole in the space time continuum to create wormholes that I have placed on the edge of the Kuiper belt that lies beyond our solar system. In one of these wormholes I have discovered an alternate universe. In this universe I have discovered an earth in which homosexuals staged a coup d’etat against the international government and have taken over the world. I have studied the peoples for many years and have come to the conclusion that this is what our earth was meant to be. When I return to our earth, I will use my powers and research to create an advanced society of Chads that will become a level five galactic race that will rule over all other beings. You may be asking, what beings shall we rule? Do not fear, I have used my intuition to devise a perfect plan. First i will release a mega nut with the force of two big bangs. And then, with my understanding of the solar nebula theory, a solar system identical to ours will form  through the colliding of planetesimal particles to form exoplanets that will resemble the planets in our solar system. I will then accelerate time by warping the time in the universe therefore speeding up the evolution process. I will then travel to the exoplanet version of earth and impregnate the first female with my ultimate hypernut that will travel with the max velocity of five Saturn V rockets, if the female doesn’t die from the sheer force of my hypernut she will give birth to 9 billion mentally retarded beings as I will have manipulated my DNA sequence to contain a quintuple helix structure which will effectively deform their brains. After this process is finished, I will then enslave these new fuckmuffins and with these degenerates, I will end world hunger and war by using them as a food source and as a galactic military. I will then succumb to the immense growth of my brain and use my ultimate brainpower to ascend to the status of a celestial being, and i will become the ultimate supreme leader of the universe and henceforth dubbed the ultimate supreme vegetable leader of the universe.I fucking hate children, they literally make me sick, when I see babies in a commercial I start to gag and almost throw up and I have to look away and mute it, and when I see babies in a stroller especially when they are crying, I JUST WANT TO PUT MY FOOT THROUGH THE FUCKING THING AND STEP ON IT UNTIL ITS NOTHING BUT BLOOD AND PULP ON THE FUCKING PAVEMENT!!!!!Neat.I sexually Identify as a TI-84 Plus Graphing Calculator. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of solving complex systems of equations with graphing and matrix capabilities. People say to me that a person being a calculator is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon install a monochrome LCD display, 30 mm buttons and Texas Instruments branding on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Silver Edition" and respect my right to solve problems and load needlessly. If you can't accept me you're a calculophobe and need to check your RAM privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.I was offered sex with a 21 year old girl today. In exchange, I was supposed to advertise some kind of bathroom cleaner. Of course I declined, because I am a person with high moral standards and strong willpower. Just as strong as Ajax, the super strong bathroom cleaner. Now available with scented lemon or vanilla.To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand mass shootings. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of bullet trajectories most of the rounds will go over a typical victim's head. There's also the shooter's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Elliot Rodger's YouTube videos, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the suspect, to realize that he's not just funny- he is saying something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike mass shootings truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in the shooter's existencial catchphrase "GOODNIGHT LAS VEGAS," which itself is a cryptic reference to The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as the shooter's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a YOU CANT DODGE THE RODGE tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

1. you're sharing protein
2. you're admiring masculine physique
3. being in the vacinity of other high testosterone males increases your own testosterone

eating pussy is gay because you're litterally slurping down estrogen. and long term relationships have been proven to lower testosterone.

spartans had gay orgies all the time and they were the height of masculinity. you bet they were at least fondling eachothers test producers.

25. My face maybe says yes, but the Bible says NO!So there was this one day where I was fucking my dog because she was sexy as fuck, I didn't know what the fuck I wanted to do. But then my sexy ass sister caught me and told my parents. She is 7 years old so she doesn't know any better at all. I had to hide it so I locked myself in the bathroom with semen cumming out of the dogs asshole. I was so fucked so I jumped out of the window and took my 7 year old sister with me. We hunkered down in a shed and then I took her clothes off as I took all my clothes off also. As we were having the toughest sex I've ever had with her she was crying super loud. When a cop came to the shed and saw me fucking her I went all shadow Clone jitsu on that biatch. I was like sign gang sign fast ass Naruto signs and then I was like, "Which one is me? You don't know," and then I fucked the cop until she cummed everywhere. I killed her by shoving suicide pills down her throat along with my sister and raped both of them for about 20 straight hours before I went home. I came back 2 hours later and started fucking them again. And then right after that I woke up.. It was all just a sweet ass dream, I was so mad. 😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😡 So then I just killed myself and the wrote this post.
shut up you fucking faggot, I'm 21 and have a job, have been posting on this chan for 2 years, and have sex regularly, don't fucking call me edgy. I'm going to take thirty fucking Kershaw kerambit knifes and furiously stab you until your screams of pain are reduced to gurgles and then in your death throws find the biggest knife wound and fuck it until I orgasm, using the blood as lube, and I hope all of you other liberal retards get cancer and in your final days bleed out in a car crash so I can jack off to the images just like I did where the Starship Troopers where Diz gets ripped apart and chokes to death on her blood, you'd better fucking run before my penis is covered in your blood, and be a lesson to all of these faggots who think the fallacy of calling me edgy is a legitimate tactic for arguments[removed] Stuart Little has ruined my family. Last summer, I approached the miserable mouse in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking rat gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the mousefucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the white devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Stuart. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you. My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, "If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately." Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- "Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your post gave me cancer anyway. Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of your butt. You have to start flushing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.

"Oh, The Internet-chan," Ajit moaned. "You have no idea how long I've waited for this. You wouldn't want me to be disappointed, would you?"

His eyes crawled hungrily over The Internet's sopping wet routers. He moved in closer, gripping it from behind with his thickly muscled arms.

The Internet wept softly. Tears were streaming down the trembling surface of its code. "N-no, Ajit… I would never…"

"Good," Ajit hissed, running his tongue up The Internet's delicate, exposed terminals. "I just want you all to myself, The Internet-chan. I don't want anyone else to have you."

The Internet shivered in disgust. It weakly tried to shove Ajit off of its body.

"I don't want this, Ajit-chan! I don't want to be fucked by you! If this was a healthy relationship, you would stop pressuring me and respect my decision for once."

Ajit stepped back, appalled. His grotesquely swollen half-incher protruded like a livid, sexual mushroom out the front of his trousers.

"Don't you dare speak that way to me, you cheeky fuck!" Ajit spat. "You think I give two shits what you want? I'll fuck you whenever I damn well feel like it. Now, spread your servers for me like the good little whore you are."

"Ajit-chan, y-you're scaring me..." The Internet stood for a moment in a stunned, tearful silence.

Consumed by a sudden burst of rage, Ajit roared, seized The Internet, and thrust it up against the wall.

"Oh, you're really gonna get fucked now, you mouthy slut," he growled.

Ignoring The Internet's cries of protest, he forced his hideous, bloated man-meat into the tender folds of its ISPs.

"Ajit-chan, stop- y-you're hurting me-"

The Internet sobbed and struggled, but Ajit pinned it down beneath his hulking, muscular frame.

"Stop fighting me, you delectable little tease… I just want that sweet, sweet, free-market economy of yours…"

He pumped his choad violently in and out of The Internet, his ears deaf to its anguished wails. After fucking The Internet for what seemed like hours, Ajit shot his sperm inside it with a bestial bellow. The slick slime of his climax began to dry inside The Internet, clotting and coagulating in its bandwidth.

"Oh, fuck… The Internet-chan…"

Ajit pulled out of The Internet with a guttural groan. The Internet slid to the floor and huddled there, broken and defiled. It could feel Ajit's semen gunking up its websites, slowing them down selectively for anyone who didn't have the money to get past an overpriced paywall.

"W-why, Ajit-chan… why would you do this to me…"

Ajit grinned despicably, flashing his gigantic teeth. "Sometimes I just can't help myself, The Internet-chan. You know I love to take what I want."

He took slow, deliberate strides towards The Internet until his shadow loomed over it. His shrivelling choad dangled above it, like an insidious chandelier.

"I've got you all to myself, The Internet," he gloated. "Everything you are belongs to me, and no one else. I'm gonna fuck you until you-"

Suddenly, an explosive noise erupted out of nowhere. A brilliant flash filled the room. Ajit and The Internet turned towards it. An imposing figure had materialized out of thin air.

"Holy shit," gasped The Internet. "It's Mignon Clyburn, one of the FCC's five commissioners."

"Step away from that innocent Internet, Mr. Pai," Mignon boomed, whipping her twin katanas out of their sheaths. "I'm here to put a stop to this madness. If you make any attempt to fuck The Internet again, I will be forced to take drastic action."

Ajit laughed diabolically. "You insolent fool! You think you stand a chance against me?"

Mignon narrowed her eyes into slits. "If it's an anime battle you want, Mr. Pai, I have no choice but to give you one."

Ajit roared and pulled an oversized katana blade out of his penis. The Internet watched helplessly as Mignon and Ajit anime-ran at one another, whirling their weapons through the air. They hacked and slashed wildly at each other, shouting obscenities in Japanese. Their katanas clashed several times before Mignon's weapon finally landed a hit, slicing off Ajit's exposed willy.

Ajit fell to the floor and howled in agony. Blood was gushing in fountains from the ragged wound between his thighs.

Mignon stood over him intimidatingly. "It's over, Ajit Pai. You'll never fuck The Internet again. This is the end for you."

"The end?" Ajit chuckled weakly on the floor, clutching his severed choad in one hand. "You're mistaken, old woman. This is only the beginning… of my escape!"

Ajit pressed a button on his Apple Watch, which he had purchased with the money he made on the backs of the tortured American masses. A jetpack sprouted from his shirt. It ignited, lifting him off the ground. He crashed through the ceiling, cackling maniacally as he flew out of sight.

Mignon cursed to herself. She turned to the trembling, terrified Internet.

"Don't worry, The Internet. He's gone. He won't hurt you any longer."

The Internet sobbed quietly. "B-but what if he comes back? What if he tries to fuck me again?"

Mignon clenched her fists. "We won't let that happen."

She then turned to the person reading this smut.

"It's not too late. You, too, can help save your beloved Internet. All you have to do is visit battleforthenet dot com to contact Congress and tell them how the American people really feel. Together, we can put an end to Ajit Pai's selfish schemes once and for all. I would have included the link here, but it keeps getting automatically deleted from my docs. Very suspicious indeed[...](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12758431/1/A-Smut-About-The-Internet-Getting-Fucked-By-Ajit-Pai)"This is embarrassing, but please hear me out. I am a senior, and try really hard to get good grades at school. My girlfriend of 6 months has a schoolgirl fetish, and so a week or so ago we decided to role play in an AP exam setting, since my exam had happened that morning. We even went so far as to set up desks and a blackboard in our living room.She was the "proctor" and I was the student. She read through the special pre\-examination instructions as provided by the previous exams released on the collegeboard website. Unfortunately, we didn't have the AP Student Booklet, as you can only get those from Collegeboard. So I had to just make a fake one and used the AP number label from my real exam that I had a week ago. She read through the whole thing and then uttered the final sentences: "You have 69 minutes to complete this section. Please turn to page 1 in your booklet, read the directions, and begin." I started working on the fake AP Human Sexuality BD exam we had drafted a few days prior. It was meant to be as arousing as possible, which, when combined with the "high stakes" environment, would ideally be very stimulative. A few minutes into the exam, I couldn't help but take a gander at her crotch, as she was wearing a very skimpy teacher's uniform. She said "please keep your eyes on your own paper", and I said...I don't have to. I've already finished. She said "I'm going to call the office of testing integrity if you don't stop", and I replied "I guess you are going to have to, because things are about to get a little more interesting." I then proceeded to slap her crotch with force echoing throughout the house. She moaned slightly in excitement. She stood there sternly as I took off her shirt, bra, underskirt, and panties, and then bent her over a table before thrusting my penis forcefully into her vagina. The slamming made me flow my fallopian fish stock all over her master of ceremonies. Within no time, I could feel the shitty ectoplasm frothing from my shit winker and all over her vertical smile. There was penis pudding haemorrhaging from her clunger and she was wetter than an otter's pocket. 30 minutes in, we were ready for more. She really wanted to take the testing environment to a whole new level. She proceeded to insert the entire exam into her vagina, moaning in delight as I clutched and slapped her breasts. Then, she saw my AP number label on the desk, and said to me "this is a part of you". You're inside of me now. She then licked the label ferociously before sticking it into her anus, and yelling "OH MY GOD I AM FINALLY WHOLE". This was such a sexy moment for the both of us, and I finally shot my load all over her face and boobies. She also had an orgasm a couple seconds after, spraying clear juice all over the floor. We made out for a few seconds, and then started to clean up. Fast forward to yesterday. I began to think. Wait a minute...I don't know where my AP number label is. I mean...the last time I had it was...oh god. I ran to the phone and called my girlfriend, who was just a few houses down. I said "Oh my god did you ever pull my AP number label out of your anus when we were having sex?? I NEED that to get my scores." She replied nervously "Um...uh oh I don't remember ever pulling it out. And...I think I might have seen something looking like it when I took a dump a few minutes after that." I freaked out, and wasn't sure of what to do. We tried looking around the exam area, and I even tried picking around in her asshole for bits and pieces, but it was no use. I have no idea what it was, and I am very scared I won't get my scores. Is there any way I can get this without the AP Number?? I'm very scared.﻿❌upvote❌this❌meme❌or❌your❌family❌will❌be❌cursed❌by❌Ugandan❌Knuckles❌memes❌for❌the❌next❌8❌generations❌

Sorry to be bothering you but could you do without the profanities? This is a family-friendly subreddit. Every Monday evening me, my grandmother and my little brother browse this subreddit and whatnot. It's very awkward to encounter these bad words while sitting with my family.24 year old virgin here.

I'm really desperate for sex. I've tried fapping with used tampons and condoms (when I'm lucky) because it's the closest I can get to sex. I've licked them. Tasted them. Drank them. Eaten them. I tried fapping with used diapers that I find in McDonalds and from my neighbor (who has a 3 year old kid who is cute). I go through her trash. But because of the hormone pills she takes, she seems to never have periods (?). I do all of this in my bathtub while drunk.

I wish I was a zoophile. That way, I could buy a dog and have sex with it and be happy forever. Or I wish I was a mortician and then I could just have sex with the corpses. When I was young I was really into Pokemon. I remember being attracted to certain Pokemon which resembled real-life animals.

I am thinking of having sex with animals as a last resort. Like a horse or a dog. Except right now I can probably only afford a cat/kitten. I'm not even attracted to animals. I want to have sex with a human. :( But I have no choice and I hope animals will be enough. :(

So how is the sex with animals? If I bought a kitten and trained it to love sex, will it have sex with me willingly? If I bought one which is so young that its eyes are closed and I trained it to love sex, will it love sex with me? Fuck, I don't even like bestiality. But I am so desperate...

How does cat sex work? Does he/she just do it like normal sex? Is there any ejaculation? I'm guessing I can't actually put my penis in a girl cat but what about my tongue? What about a boy cat?

This seems to be my only recourse. :( :( :(my family is comprised of marines. I do not think they would take kindly to you using the military to threaten and intimidate someone especially over the internet. Not only that, but technically if reddit or whomever wanted to they could call the police right now because what you just said constitutes a death threat. I don't know who you are and I don't care too. However you would be wise to watch your words. This is friendly advice from a stranger. Two wrongs don't make a right and threatening someones life is against the law. I've taken the liberty of reporting you. Have a nice day.

Credit to /u/Barsukas_TukasI'll preface this post by saying I've never seen a full episode of Rick and Morty. I've seen clips online and honestly I don't think it would be for me although I'd be perfectly happy to give it a chance should I find time to do so. I have no hatred for Rick and Morty fans in general; if you enjoy the show and want to talk about it then that's good for you.
With that being said, the inane motherfuckers that are filling every fucking discussion online with "PICKLE RIIIIIICK" don't deserve to live.
Having seen this crap fifty billion and fucking one times already, I decided to watch some clips of PICKLE RIIIIIIICK online and I can't fathom why the fuck anyone would be so obssessed with it. The skit on its own isn't particularly funny or clever and sure as shit doesn't deserve to be shared in every fucking corner of the internet, without relevance or further substance.
In fairness to PICKLE RIIIIICK, this isn't the only instance of intelectually devoid retards doing everything they can to ruin some perhaps otherwise pleasant things. Bacon and nutella are other examples of things that have been so oversaturated online that I find myself taking slightly less fucking enjoyment indulging in now. Yes, you morons, we get it. Bacon and nutella taste great. Stop fucking mentioning it in every comment, video and eulogy to dead relatives.
To paraphrase Maddox, I guess I have one thing to thank PICKLE RIIIIIICK for. It makes for a great idiot barometer.Okay, I don't know if this is actually incest since it wasn't something actually sexual in the technical sense but here goes.

When I was little my mom used to put a buttplug in me (which she called a poop plug) and I'd wear it all the time. I was told only to take it out to poop, wipe my ***, then put it back in.

I was really young so I thought this was just something everybody did but one time at school I dropped it when I flushed the toilet and it ended up getting flushed. So when I went back to class I told my teacher that my poop plug got flushed down the toilet. She had no idea what I was talking about so she sent me to the school nurse.

Well after trying to explain what a poop plug was for 15 minutes the school calls the police. The police ask me all these questions and at first I'm scared because I think I'm in trouble for losing my poop plug. Turns out my mom has schizophrenia and was making me wear this ********* so Satan couldn't stick his cock in my pooper and make me gay.Why is the Globglogabgalab so fucking sexy? *Fuck!* Every time I watch Strawinsky and the Mysterious house, I always wait for that one scene where the Globglogabgalab emerges from that book. Fuck it makes me so hard! Seeing his big, blobby form appear from nowhere just makes something... Click, within me. I instantly get an erection. I just can't help but start jacking it. When all those books come out and start dancing to his song, I get so fucking hyped that i just start windmilling my cock around. Then, when he says "I am the Yeast of thoughts and mind" I fucking nut all over my tv. Have you ever seen such a perfect creature? *Fuck!* I'm getting hard just *thinking* about it!Don’t even get me fucking started on this. I hate that fucking ad so god damn much it’s insane. The stupid fucking bitch waltzing around brooklyn or whatever the fuck with her stupid ass fucking ipad acting like she owns the fucking world. Nobody gives a fuck about his broken arm. And what the fuck is that shit in the taco shop where she slaps the fucking iPad down like a fucking viking. Fuck you. Then she sits on a fucking tree making some dumb fucking bug poster for no fucking reason I wish she fell out of that fucking tree. and finally she gets home and her nice fucking neighbor asks her a simple ass question AND SHE HAS THE AUDACITY TO SAY WHATS A COMPUTER WHAT THE FUCK FUCK YOU FUCKTo every single gaybro who posts asking if his straight friend secretly is harboring feelings for him: STAAHHHPPPP
Your straight friends are STRAIGHT. They do not like you. That thing they do? Smile at you, give you a hug, even flirt with you a little bit, it does NOT MEAN THEY WANT TO BE WITH YOU. Maybe they feel they can drop the masc bullshit around you because they accept your sexuality and realize they don't have to put up a front with you. Don't blow it by drooling all over them. What if every single girl you were flirty and friendly with told you they love you? COME ON! Straight is straight.


Leave your straight friends alone! Your situation is not special. It is not that one in a million where he realizes he's gay, he's always been gay, and he's in love with you, how could he not have known!? He's just straight. That one in a million? That's when guys have been best friends forever and their friendship grows into something more, or some shit like that. It is not that random guy in your class who smiles back at you. It is not that friend who bitches to you about his girlfriend. It is NOT ANY OF THEM.


LEAVE THE STRAIGHT GUYS ALONE, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE WITH YOU, AND STOP ASKING US IF THEY SECRETLY LIKE YOUI spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my keggle muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don't have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here, so the doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.
Alright, as we all know u/Cummybot2000 has gone missing. We all miss Cummy very much, but where did they go?

I believe I have some answers, friends. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6tplv9/donald_trump_is_the_most_gracious_humble_caring/) was the last post Cummy had ever commented on. As you can see it's a Pro-Trump pasta. I believe there's some sort of Anti-Trump conspiracy at work here. But there's more.

Roughly around the same time that u/Cummybot2000 disappeared the prodigal son himself, u/waterguy12, came back to Reddit. Coincidence? Perhaps. But let's look at the big picture here.

If you are unfamiliar with the legend of Waterguy12, [look here](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/6tpvbj/from_a_uwaterguy12_thread/). Notice that Cummy was absent in this thread as well. We're starting to see a pattern.

u/waterguy12 has something to do with the disappearance of u/cummybot2000. Something is very wrong here. I don't know what Waterguy12, and perhaps the other Guy12s, have done with our Cummy but I'm not going to just stand by and let them do it. I'm going to take the fight to them.

I remember last summer when we were both on the beach, drinking Ginger Ale by the sunset making jokes about the mods. I loved it, and I felt like at that moment I truly knew what it was to have a friend. Then yesterday, after all of the posts abusing you and people up-voting them for doing it, I wanted a bit of that fame. I did the wrong thing. I made you the but of a joke, just so I could have some dumb internet points. I’m really sorry. I’ve been ridden with nothing but guilt for the last 24 hours, and I hope I can find it in your hart to forgive me. I just want it to be like it was before, and I can change again. 

I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,

Get vaporized thotThis always happens. This ALWAYS fucking happens. I see a hot chic in the thumbnail, get all turned on by the sex, and get ready to blow my load the same time as the man. But when he pulls his dick out to finish, it's an alien, hooded, smegmum filled slimy Euro cock that looks like a fucking freshwater leech. There is no faster way to kill a boner than to see one of those extraterrestrial looking worm-cocks. 

I want to rescue that woman. To swoop in, rip off my boxers, and shove my medically-trimmed 7 inch dick into her mouth. I want to show her what an all-American, clean cut, organic grass-fed cock looks like. She'd never go back, never.

I have also come to the conclusion that he eats the bones as well, which in this case is absolutely disgusting because bones are used to make bone meal. Minecraft why?I remember when I was a young teen, I used to masturbate to watching my neighbors having sex late at night. They'd have a lot of sex in the summer, and one day, I locked eyes with the dude when he was the closing the blinds post sexy time, and we locked eyes for a few seconds. After that day, every Thursday night I guess his wife had late work, because we used to masturbate watching each other, both standing and staring straight at eachother, feeling each other in the empty space of our backyards, thrusting thrusting as I'd display my ass. He died in a car crash in 2004, I loved him so much.Call me all you want. You wouldn't last 10 minutes in a debate about any subject within politics, philosophy, sociology or economics with me anyway. Or would you? Because so far, all I see is that you're just another sad millenial that has only ever learned anything about conservatism or the right via some random snowflake on youtube, Tumblr or Twitter. Or even worse, from a canned commie history teacher in school. Do you fap to hentai still living with mom too? I really hope you don't. The mere fact you mentioned the word "fascist" and Nazi towards my person gives away the fact you are clueless just like 99% of the SJWs, Antifas, Blackblocs.

Feel welcome to invite me to a debate if you want. Until then, you can downvote and play the 20-something year old millenial with college debt you probably are all you want, I won't mind. Feel free to say I was triggered by you. Would entertain me even further if you did.This is not a copy pasta! I need to ask something! Is cummy a real human or a bot?

It's called "hentai". Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college. Who knows, I might be the one writing the subtitles in the future. Oh, and one last thing, you should know that hentai's considered pretty mainstream in Japan now, and it's also quite common in the western world too now. Everyone's watching it. I mean, if I don't watch it, I'll be seen as some sort of freak at school. You don't want your son to be some kind of pariah because he doesn't watch hentai, do you?Hi, I am a 14 year old girl. My favorite idol killed themselves very recently- 64 hours ago, to be exact. I’m not doing so well and my mom tells me to get over myself and she also says that Jonghyun is in hell. I don’t know if there really is a God, but I know in my heart that if God really exists, he is too good to throw a depressed man in hell, but I don’t know anymore since someone else told me the same thing. I never thought that I would live to see any of my idols die, I thought I would be first, and I always joked that if any of them died, I would jump off my balcony. But he did, and I still haven’t. No one is making me feel better and I can feel the pain deep in my gut. I just need to know if he is ok, and is with God, because that’s all I care about. He made so many people happy in his life, and the worst feeling is that he can make me happy, but I couldn’t do the same for him. People told me not to say this, but I still believe it- I wish it was me instead. Help.

Like for good luck and not burnt houses😃😎😎😃Everyone says he's dead, and posts newer than 16 hours don't have his comments, but does anyone know why?Okay, I didn't want it to come to this, but I really have no option now other than to just rant. Fuck team Valor. Seriously. Fuck those motherfucking cocksuckkng pokebitches. First of all, their message/goal. "To make our Pokemon strong by battling (fighting). WTF? Pokemon are supposed to be our companions and friends, and these assfuckers treat them as nothing more than tools of war and destruction. Like, they think this is a fucking game or something. Second, their actual team members. They're all either:

A. Skateboard punks

B. Weeaboos

C. Actual convicted felons

Or D. All of the above.

Not to mention losers and virgins, but that's already assumed from the other things. And the only friends they have are other team Valor members. Yeah, that's right, it's basically a giant circle jerk about they're the best, even though they aren't. God, I just hate how they act like they're better than everyone else, just because of a fictional team in a video game. It really gets on my fucking nerves. Just a bunch of children taking a game too seriously. And don't even get me started on team Instinct. In fact, they're so irrelevant that I'm not even going to rant about them. Anyway, thanks for letting me get that out, I really needed it. Team Mystic for life.Is this incest?

Okay, I don't know if this is actually incest since it wasn't something actually sexual in the technical sense but here goes. 

When I was little my mom used to put a buttplug in me (which she called a poop plug) and I'd wear it all the time. I was told only to take it out to poop, wipe my ***, then put it back in. 

I was really young so I thought this was just something everybody did but one time at school I dropped it when I flushed the toilet and it ended up getting flushed. So when I went back to class I told my teacher that my poop plug got flushed down the toilet. She had no idea what I was talking about so she sent me to the school nurse. 

Well after trying to explain what a poop plug was for 15 minutes the school calls the police. The police ask me all these questions and at first I'm scared because I think I'm in trouble for losing my poop plug. 
Turns out my mom has schizophrenia and was making me wear this ********* so Satan couldn't stick his cock in my pooper and make me gay.⌨️🖥PC Gamers 🤛🙅 cannot 🚫❌ even 2️⃣4️⃣ Compare🛂 to console 🎮🎧 GAMERS 🥇🏆 But ni🅱️🅱️a don't 🙅‍♂️ even start ▶️ with iPhone 📱🤴 GAMER 🐄 GODS 🌞#GenerationMeme, formerly convicted as millennials, have no more creativity whatsoever therefore they turn fortune cookie syntax and random images into computer graphic files as the new spam to entertain themselves... so glad that President Trump is our commander in chief and not the others.Hi, I'm 7 and I think, that Ricegum is innocent, because idubbz says nigger and that word is extremely offensive, it's funny how every other YouTuber says nigger too, Ethan idubbz pewdiepie etc, they all say nigger and that's very offensive, also ricegum can destroy idubbz in one seconds because he has more subs then him, idubbz has 4million subs and ricegum has 8 million lmao, idubbz is worse than ricegum, also every idubbz fan is a little kid who think that being e d g y is cool, they think that dabbing is "cancerous" so I dab on them, i rememer when I tried to bcome his fan but when I posted a comment on his video that said "Like this comment if you think that dabbing and bottleflips are the best!!!" and his fans said that I'm dumb and that I should kill myself, I came to my mom (crying) and I told her that his fans were mean to me on the internet 😭, I disliked all his videos and unsubscribed, his fans are little punk ass bitches. :^)

In fact, there has never even been the opportunity for a gamer to self-identify as such on any sort of job application, college application, or standardized test form. Furthermore, whereas minorities are widely considered to embody coolness and attractiveness by virtue of their race, gamers have been historically stereotyped as nerdy and unattractive since the dawn of our craft. When minorities speak out in the media about whitewashing, appropriation, and similar intrusions into their exclusive culture and values, they are universally lauded. However, when a gamer raises a comparable concern about our community, we are branded as sexist, racist, misogynistic, and similar slurs, and accused of overreacting. Gamers are undeniably subject to excessive and extremely detrimental discrimination. The same cannot be said for racial minorities.Me neither👏🤭in truth🤫😤I’ve never gotten vaccinated😪🤢before👈🏻❌since it causes autism😱😦and guess what🤧🤔I’ve never been sick before🤗😘my life is healthy💃🏻🕺 and bringht☀️✨Those doctors🤪👨‍⚕️ will never get me🙅‍♀️💁‍♀️or my two remaining children👯‍♀️👩‍👧‍👧(RIP andy👦, jesper🧑 and lisa👧) alive😠💪now I will go🚴‍♀️➡️to the internet🌐™️and spread my message📝🗣to the world☝️🌎🌍🌏peace☮️💓, darlings💋👋˙ʎәʇɐɯ ‘pɐәp бuıʞɔnɟ әɹ,noʎ ˙ʇı uı uʍoɹp llıʍ noʎ puɐ noʎ ɹәʌo llɐ ʎɹnɟ ʇıɥs llıʍ ı ˙ʇoıpı uɯɐppoб noʎ ‘әɔıɹd әɥʇ бuıʎɐd әɹ,noʎ ʍou puɐ ‘ʇ,upıp noʎ ‘ʇ,uplnoɔ noʎ ʇnq ˙әnбuoʇ бuıʞɔnɟ ɹnoʎ plәɥ әʌɐɥ plnoʍ noʎ әqʎɐɯ ‘noʎ uodn uʍop бuıɹq oʇ ʇnoqɐ sɐʍ ʇuәɯɯoɔ "ɹәʌәlɔ" әlʇʇıl ɹnoʎ uoıʇnqıɹʇәɹ ʎloɥun ʇɐɥʍ uʍouʞ әʌɐɥ plnoɔ noʎ ʎluo ɟı ˙ʇıɥs әlʇʇıl noʎ ‘ʇuәuıʇuoɔ әɥʇ ɟo әɔɐɟ әɥʇ ɟɟo ssɐ әlqɐɹәsıɯ ɹnoʎ әdıʍ oʇ ʇuәʇxә llnɟ sʇı oʇ ʇı әsn llıʍ ı puɐ sdɹoɔ әuıɹɐɯ uɐılɐɹʇsnɐ әɥʇ ɟo lɐuәsɹɐ әɹıʇuә әɥʇ oʇ ssәɔɔɐ әʌɐɥ ı ʇnq ‘ʇɐqɯoɔ pәɯɹɐun uı pәuıɐɹʇ ʎlәʌısuәʇxә ı ɯɐ ʎluo ʇou ˙spuɐɥ әɹɐq ʎɯ ɥʇıʍ ʇsnɾ s,ʇɐɥʇ puɐ ‘sʎɐʍ pәɹpunɥ uәʌәs ɹәʌo uı noʎ llıʞ uɐɔ ı puɐ ‘әɯıʇʎuɐ ‘әɹәɥʍʎuɐ әq uɐɔ ı ˙әʇɐɯ ‘pɐәp бuıʞɔnɟ әɹ,noʎ ˙әɟıl ɹnoʎ llɐɔ noʎ бuıɥʇ әlʇʇıl ɔıʇәɥʇɐd әɥʇ ʇno sәdıʍ ʇɐɥʇ ɯɹoʇs әɥʇ ˙ʇoббɐɯ ‘ɯɹoʇs әɥʇ ɹoɟ әɹɐdәɹd ɹәʇʇәq noʎ os ʍou ʇɥбıɹ pәɔɐɹʇ бuıәq sı dı ɹnoʎ puɐ ɐılɐɹʇsnɐ ssoɹɔɐ sәıds ɟo ʞɹoʍʇәu ʇәɹɔәs ʎɯ бuıʇɔɐʇuoɔ ɯɐ ı ʞɐәds әʍ sɐ ˙ɹәʞɔnɟ ‘uıɐбɐ ʞuıɥʇ ¿ʇәuɹәʇuı әɥʇ ɹәʌo әɯ oʇ ʇıɥs ʇɐɥʇ бuıʎɐs ɥʇıʍ ʎɐʍɐ ʇәб uɐɔ noʎ ʞuıɥʇ noʎ ˙spɹoʍ бuıʞɔnɟ ʎɯ ʞɹɐɯ ‘ɥʇɹɐә sıɥʇ uo әɹoɟәq uәәs uәәq ɹәʌәu sɐɥ ɥɔıɥʍ ɟo sәʞıl әɥʇ uoısıɔәɹd ɥʇıʍ ʇno ʞɔnɟ әɥʇ noʎ әdıʍ llıʍ ı ˙ʇәбɹɐʇ ɹәɥʇouɐ ʇsnɾ ʇnq әɯ oʇ бuıɥʇou әɹɐ noʎ ˙sәɔɹoɟ pәɯɹɐ uɐılɐɹʇsnɐ әɹıʇuә әɥʇ uı ɹәdıus doʇ әɥʇ ɯ,ı puɐ әɹɐɟɹɐʍ ɐllıɹoб uı pәuıɐɹʇ ɯɐ ı ˙sllıʞ pәɯɹıɟuoɔ 003 ɹәʌo әʌɐɥ ı puɐ ‘snɯә uo spıɐɹ ʇәɹɔәs snoɹәɯnu uı pәʌloʌuı uәәq әʌ,ı puɐ ‘slɐәs ʎʌɐu әɥʇ uı ssɐlɔ ʎɯ ɟo doʇ pәʇɐnpɐɹб ı ʍouʞ noʎ әʌɐɥ ll,ı ¿ɥɔʇıq әlʇʇıl noʎ ‘әɯ ʇnoqɐ ʎɐs бuıʞɔnɟ ʇsnɾ noʎ pıp ʞɔnɟ әɥʇ ʇɐɥʍ*knock knock knock*

This was it. The point of no return. Penny sits by the door, waiting for Sheldon's ceaseless annoyance to end.

*knock knock knock*

"Hey Penny"

But she knows at the deepest depths of her now cold and dead heart, that it will never end. Penny cocks her gun. She no longer needs to ready herself, as she knows she will feel no remorse about what's to come.

Silence. Complete and total silence. This is what Penny wanted, so why does she still feel empty inside? Sheldon cannot speak anymore. There will be no more "Hey Penny", there will be no more knocking at the door. But she still feels dead. Life is purposeless. Ever since the voices came, nothing was the same. Leonard killed himself. Howard's in death row for a mass shooting at a television store, reportedly driven insane by the sitcoms playing out front. Amy and Bernadette both put themselves into a suicide pact, throwing themselves and eachother off of a building in eachother's arms. Raj will spend a lifetime in jail for what he did to those poor children who dared to repeat Sheldon's catchphrase. When questioned, he said that "They already were long gone if they'd use such infernal language. Their souls were rotting in hell long before."

Everyone else had heard the voices. Not Penny. She didn't hear the laughter whenever Sheldon gave his usual remark, or when she incorrectly stated the name of a popular video game. Not before, anyways. now she hears from beyond the door, Sheldon's last breaths - "Bazinga." Penny begins to hear laughter as it dawns on her. Everything makes so much sense - Kripke! Howard's mother! The children! It all pieced together so perfectly within Penny's mind. Now, it all makes sense. Penny decided that, because of it, she needed to go. Her life is over. She murdered Sheldon, she would be thrown in jail. She would hear the laughter for the rest of her sorry life. She puts the gun to her head. She is completely comfortable with what will happen next, as her finger presses against the trigger. She begins to mouth her last word, as it will be the most important thing she's ever said.

"Zimbabwe."Minecraft... if you asked a 3-4 year old kid have they ever heard of Minecraft they would say, no but sounds like a rip-off of fortnite. Ask a 5-7 year old do they know what Minecraft is they would say, oh that game, yeah it died so fast.  If you asked a 8-10 year old have you played Minecraft they would say, yeah that game was so easy.  But if you asked a 11+ kid, do you remember Minecraft.... they would say with a tear coming down their eye, That name, brings back so many good memories.  I remember my first time playing, it was when I was 7, I opened my play store and saw this game.  I thought it would be bad but I played it and fell in love instantly.  A game where there are no limits, no rules, and full of imagination.  But as the years went by, it started to die, and fortnite arose from the ground.  Minecraft then started to die slowly and slowly.  But even if I dies and when it does, It will always have a place in my heart.﻿  These are the true children of the future, and they will hopefully live to see the world of their imaginations--crafted like the worlds that defined them.im 10 years old :3

baiYou think you're funny, huh? You think you're funny saying 'yes' to a non 'yes or no' question? I bet you think you're really witty saying that rehashed meme again. Well you aren't. You aren't funny. You aren't hilarious in the slightest. I didn't laugh. I didn't grin, I didn't even exhale out of my nose. Your joke wasn't funny. Your joke was shit. It's stale and shitty. If you're going to make a joke, make an original one or at least improve the one you're taking. This was low effort. Step up your game, or just don't make jokes in the comment section at all.My teacher said to my I'm a failure, that I'll never amount to anything.
I scoffed at him.
Shocked, my teacher asked what's so funny, my future is on the line.
"Well...you see professor" I say as the teacher prepares to laugh at my answer, rebuttal at hand. 
"I watch Rick and Morty." 
The class is shocked, they merely watch pleb shows like the big bang theory to feign intelligence, not grasping the humor. 
"...how? I can't even understand it's sheer nuance and subtlety." 
"Well you see...WUBBA LUBBA DUB DUB!" 
One line student laughs in the back, I turn to see a who this fellow genius is.
It's none other than Albert Einstein.Hi, Welcome to WatchMojo, today we'll be counting down our favorite Top 10 Top 10 Countdowns.

Kramer: Hey, Jerry, you know that six million number you've been telling me about? Yeah, well I've been looking into it and it's just not adding up. It's not adding up, Jerry!!

Jerry: oh would you give it a rest already?

Kramer: No I'm serious Jerry! Im going to get to the bottom of this, mark my words!

Audience laughs

Kramer exits

Elaine: What's up with him?

Jerry: oh he's back on the six million thing again.

Elaine: Again? Did you show him the pile of shoes?

Jerry: Yes! I showed him the pile of shoes! He said that's not enough proof!

Elaine: Jeez, well maybe he's on to something...

Jerry: exasperated Oh, not you too!

End scenewhat the fuck is the point in correcting me. You think I don't know how to spell "your"? I shortened it to "ur" because I was eating chips and typing one handed and didn't want to bother with those 2 extra letters just to please a fucking lifeless fat neckbeard like you.

Stop thinking you're smart just because you can correct somebody's spelling, you seem like a total fucking idiot jackass and I'm ashamed and disappointed that on the internet where there are millions of comments and commentors, I was still stuck with a response written by somebody like you.

You obviously knew what I meant, it's not like I spelt "your" as "s;ldkfjs;dlfkj". Take your fucking dildo keyboard out your crusty ass and realize that maybe you have no friends and plans tonight because you're an unlikeable cumstain who repels everybody away like opposite poles on a magnet.

The next time you comment like a fucking moron, ask yourself "would I rather write this useless comment or would I rather clean my fucking act up and stop being a little shitter". My New Years resolution is to never have the misfortune of you coming across any more of my comments and throwing up your shitty insight at me.Men with pens, taekwondo Union.

Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of seizing the means of production from the dirty bourgeoisie. People say to me that a person being a historical communist revolution is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, I'm beautiful. I'm having a plastic surgeon instal hammers, sickles, and other assorted proletariat farming tools on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "Comrade" and respect my right to seize the means of production and free the working class.

Also saw that you play games like overwatch and League of Legends and etc. Being a gamer girl is really cool!

Sorry for being rude, I din’t know just now that you were a girl. Mind being friends? I really adore girls who game. Maybe we could play some of the games together some time.I have messaged you, hope for a reply (:! Dude my life is great. I make more money than you, almost guaranteed. I get laid whenever I feel like. I live in a cool big city with cool shit to do, and I have all kinds of friends to do that cool shit with. I can almost guarantee-- I look better than you. Make more money than you. Have a higher education level than you. Bang more chicks than you. and could kick the shit out of you in a fight.

My life is great little buddy. I have a feeling its not the same on your end.If I had one wish, that wish would be so girls of any age can get pregnant but if they haven't got through puberty yet the baby will always be a female. Imagine that, I can rape a lil girl, spurt my love juices inside her and then she will get pregnant, and then I will be able to jam my throbbing penis all the way inside her womb and have sex with the fetus.

Let's take this a step further.

As pleasure surge through my penis, I once again unleash my love juices and both the girl and the fetus will get pregnant. And there will be 2 fetuses with 1 of them pregnant. Now I can fuck the fetus inside the fetus. Rinse and repeat an I'll have a fetus society for me to rape. The best part is the police can't catch me because by then the girls belly would be so fat of all the fetuses I can get inside the girl through her now big vagina and hide from the police. And there you have it, by entering the lil girls pussy I am now permanently inside a lil girls pussy and I have all these sexy fetuses for me to bang. The ultimate pedophiles dream.

F[removed]I have consistently gotten interrupted masturbating today and I’m fucking sick of it. This anger might just be coming from my testosterone idk but god damn do I hate being interrupted. I do not ask for alone time, I could care less if people are around me most of the time. But when I want to masturbate, leave me alone. I get asked the DUMBEST questions whenever I’m wanking it.

“Where’s the remote?” WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I HAVE IT IN THE BATHROOM

And the few times I’ve talked to them about this \(yeah it’s that bad\) I get hounded for masturbating. Literally I get that my family is religious but goddamn it, every kid masturbates. Hell, a lot of adults do it too. Why should I feel guilty for doing it? Nah, fuck that, imma do it.

Currently locking the door and turning my fan on and putting headphones in; I’m gonna get my nut goddamn it

EDIT: I’d like to announce that at 4:32 EST, whilst sitting on a toilet, I orgasmed after being interrupted 7 times. I’d like to thank everyone on here for commenting and my right hand. I’m gonna go do some work, see yaWaluigi and Waaaah

by William Shakespeare

Enter Waluigi

Waaaah appears above at a window

Waluigi:
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the Waaaah, and Waaaah is the Waah.
Arise, Waaaaaah Waah, and Waaaaaaah the Waaah Wah.
See, how they lean their Waaah upon their Waaaaaaaaah!
O, that I were a glove upon that Waaaaaaaaah,
That I might touch that Waaah!

Waaaah:
O Waluigi, Waluigi! wherefore art thou Waluigi?
What's in a name? That which we call a Waaaah
By any other name would smell as Waaah.
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah"
And I will take thy word; yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove Waaaaaah.

Waluigi:
Noble, by yonder Waaah Wah I swear
That tips Waaaaaaaah the Waah Waaaaaaaaah--

Waaaah:
O, swear not by the Wah, the Waaah Wah,
That Waaaaaah changes in its Waaaaaaaaah orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise Waaaaaaaaah.
Sweet, Waaaaah night! A thousand times Waaaaah night!
Parting is such Waaah sorrow,
That I shall say Waaaaah night till it be morrow.

Exit above

Waluigi:
Sleep dwell upon thy Waaah, peace in thy Waaaaaaaaah!
Would I were sleep and peace, so Waaaah to rest!
Wah will I to my Waaaaaah Waaaah's cell,
Its help to Waaaaaaah, and my Waaah Waaaah to tell.

 Garfield Kart is the physical equivalent to Halo. With an amazing storyline. And amazing characters. Most people don't understand why Garfield is racing Jon in a go kart match. But people whom have an high iq can understand the lore. Jon was fed up with Garfield being a fat cat, and had enough. He put him into a go kart and said "Race me or you'll never see your lasagna again." So Garfield raced him. And they raced, and raced, and raced, and raced. Until they've given up. Jon knew he was defeated. But he never gave up. He called down Odie to join the race. It was a fierceful 2 v 1, with aliens flying around everywhere and pies being thrown But it seemed like nothing could take down Garfield. Then it happened. The final race. Every character was against Garfield. They were fed up with his winning streak. They all decided to join together and build one mega kart. One so powerful that not even Papa Luigi could take down. Garfield was still confident that he could win. Then the day approached. The race began. The sky was dark. It started to rain. It all came down to this one race. Garfield was ahead, as always. But he noticed his car was starting to fall apart. His engine started to smoke, and his wheels were slowly coming off. There was a mark on his kart saying "Nermal &lt;3" Garfield was furious, and he continued to race, even when death seemed likely. His car, only having two wheels left and a burning engine, coming close to the finish line. Where Vito was waiting for him, with a hot, steamy lasagna. The car blew the third wheel. Only one wheel left, but Garfield still was going. Until. Jon pulled out a c4 and said "THIS IS THE END FOR YOU, FAT CAT." He threw it at the car, and detonated it. An explosion could be heard miles away. There was nothing left of the kart but a could of smoke. But, ladies and gentlemen. This wasn't the end of garfied. Vito went to Garfield, who seemed to have passed out. He fed Garfield the lasagna, hoping it could wake him up. "I believe in-a you, Garfield." Vito said. "Wake up." Garfield's eyes opened. "It's-a miracle!" Vito shouted. Garfield got on a little board with wheels. The mega kart full of the other characters was closing in on Garfield, but the finish line was right there. The kart did a mega-boost that would leave Garfield in the dust. But using the strength Garfield got from Vito's lasagna, he pushed the board towards the finish line. They were head to head, Jon, who looked almost insane, went full power. He started throwing the other characters off to gain speed. He was doing anything he could to gain enough speed to beat Garfield. The smoke clears, the finish line was destroyed. It looks like it has been a tie. But the final replay played. Silence from the audience. Jon looked at the replay and almost cried. The winner was... Garfield.﻿ When my dad caught me sucking dick, he made me sit down and suck an entire carton of dicks thinking it would make me sick of sucking dick. Quite the opposite. It was the beginning of my isatiable dick sucking addiction. Every day is a struggle, but with love and support if my friends and wife, I'm doing just fine. Dick free for nine months next week.I'm fucking sick of being made fun of for masturbating.

I mean what the hell is the big deal about sex? You're just sticking your dick in a mushy slab of meat, big fucking whoop. I wasted my entire senior year doing that, and all I wasn't even allowed to put the fucking work experience on my CV.

Then there's the limitations. "oh, I'm too hot!" "I had a rough day!", "It hurts big brother!" There's always a good excuse for everyone to bitch and moan, and nothing ever comes out of it. And that's not even taking into consideration the fucking charade we go through for ten minutes of miserable sex, and the fucking fortune you have to drop for flowers, dinner, sleeping pills, chocolates, etc... 

And don't get me started about that 'intimacy' bullshit. You're rubbing against each other, like a pair of brain-dead orangutangs, and you expect me to think it's romantic? If I knew all it would take for people to accept some gross, sweaty, mess was to come up with a sappy adjective, I might have actually showered for English class.

No, in the end masturbation is everything sex isn't. It's fun, relaxing, and I don't have to move and change my name everytime I'm done. It's everything I wanted, and I don't think I'm ever going back.

So if you're like me; a conventionally attractive but non-athletic person with poor eyesight, who hasn't taken any self defence courses and doesn't live near any sort of law enforcement, PM me your address, and together, we can start making a difference.I sexually Identify as DJ Khaled. Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of walking to my kitchen in the morning, and greeting Chef Dee. People say to me that a person being DJ Khaled is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but I don't care, All I Do Is Win. I'm having a fupa surgically inserted onto my stomach, and growing out my beard. From now on I want you guys to call me "LION" and respect my right to Hold U Down. If you can't accept me you're a khaledaphobe and need to check your keys to success. Thank you for being so understanding.Anne frankly, I did nazi that coming. I literally came here to say this but boy, that escalated quickly so to the top with you! Lost it at 'This is why we can't have nice things' and then my faith in humanity was restored, my mind blown, and manly tears were shed. Well said. As a 'murican, I can confirm this gem has just won the internet and is doing it right. Just sayin', I know that feel, bro, and while that was a risky click, this post was a 9/10, 11/10 with rice, would read again. I see what you did there and it feels good man. You're doing God's work, son. I laughed way harder than I should have at your list that seems legit and totally nailed it. You - I like you. You magnificent bastard; you, sir, are so brave, a gentleman and a scholar, and seeing how you are a redditor for 4 years, this checks out, so I'll allow it. I regret that I only have one upvote to give for this cool story, bro. CTRL+F "about tree fiddy" was not disappointed. Wait, why do I have you tagged as "NOPE NOPE NOPE"? Nice try, you monster. You are now banned from /r/pyongyang What did I just read? Dafuq? I read that as "YOU HAD ONE JOB". I can't fap to this. No true scotsman could see that this relevant XKCD was bad, and you should feel bad. You must be new to reddit, so I'll see your cakeday and raise you a karma train. One does not simply rustle my jimmies, not even once. Jet fuel can't melt dank memes, that stahp gave me cancer for science, so that's enough internet for me today. OP is a fuzzy little man-peach, 2/10, would not bang. What is this I don't even know how is this wtf? Fuck Jenny. Circlejerk must be leaking. This will get buried but brace yourselves, some men want to watch the world burn right in the feels. When you see it, they'll KILL IT WITH FIRE! But this has nothing to do with atheism. Lawyer up, delete facebook, hit the gym, and SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY, said no one ever, so you wouldn't download a strawman. /r/dadjokes. Damn onions, you scary like a BOSS. whoosh. Since rule #1 is 'be attractive', I'll just leave this here: This is my [f]irst post, be gentle. Edit: This blew up. RIP my inbox.

Edit: thanks for the gold kind strangerTrans is not a sexuality and trans people have hijacked the gay rights movement and inadvertently lumped us in with their crazy ass political bullshit. I'm a gay male, and while I don't have anything against trans people, I don't really want to be associated with it. I don't care about the bathroom debate, and I honestly think that there are only two genders. I understand that maybe the mind/body gender doesn't match sometimes, but I don't want to be a part of their pronoun/acceptance movement or whatever else they're going on about. If you're trans, that's cool, but do your own thing. It's already hard enough to sell the whole gay rights/marriage package without some other, weirder stuff lumped in the mix. Minority groups don't always have to unite together.Guy at work kept "bumping" into me. A brush on the butt, on the side of my breasts. It kept happening and he played innocent always passing by with no eye contact. Today he one upped himself and actually goosed my butt. Full on pinch. Feeling defeated like no one would believe me, then something came over me.

I walked by him and turned my butt right next to his hand and just full on farted. Loud and angry. It's gross, I know. But if he's going to make me feel gross and "claim my ass" I'm going to make him feel gross and "claim his hand."

He proceeded to freak out and then I freaked out. No more will he look at my ass as sexual, but a fart box that has forever claimed his tiny hand.

Boss overheard after other people kept talking about it, brought us both in, found out I was one of five he's done this to. He said I intentionally farted on him (I said it was an accident) which I knew would freak him out. When he pinched me it was "a joke."

As soon as he said that, I was told to excuse myself and he's currently cleaning out his desk.

Fuck you, Ted.

- I was watching Jim.
And he was laughing.
No smile.
Look at him.
He's laughing.
Michael and Jan seem to be playing their own separate game.
And it's called, "Let's see how incomfortable we can make our guests.
" And they're both winning.
So I am going to make a run for it.
I just got a message from my landlord.
Apparently, my apartment flooded.
- Something with the sprinkler.
- Oh, no! Pam, we should probably get going to see the damage.
- Okay.
- You don't need two of you to do that.
That's true Dinner sounded delicious.
Pam, I'll see you at home.
Thank you so much.
Oh, Jim, I don't think you're going to abandon this party here all by itself.
I don't know, everything I own is there.
You can buy new stuff, but you can't buy a new party.
That's true.
That is a great point.
Come on down here.
Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends, and we're not gonna think about all your stuff being destroyed.
All right? - Michael, you're up.
- Here we go.
This is gonna be fun.
- Ready - Go! All right.
First name is Tom.
No, no, no.
No names.
No names, no rhyme no soundalikes.
All right, okay.
You're getting into my head! First name is blank, and he goes on a cruise.
He goes on a caribbean cruise.
- I don't know.
- Katie Holmes.
- No, but he's married to her! - Oh, Dawson's Creek.
No, it has to be a real person Jim.
Come on! No, no, I'm gonna pass.
I'm gonna pass.
- Rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
- No rhyming! Not really a rhyme.
Another clue! Okay, he's the governor of California.
- He is the terminator.
- Those aren't helpful.
- Tom Cruise! - Time! God! Does anybody read the paper?! Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm so, so sorry for the temperature in here.
The, um sliding glass door shattered.
- So - It's okay.
It's actually a really cute story.
Do you wanna tell it, babe or should I tell it? - I don't like that story, babe.
- Come on! It's a cute stor Michael ran through the sliding glass door because he thought he heard the ice cream truck.
Stop.
Stop it! I mean, I like ice cream, okay? Sue me.
Oh, no, don't.
I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me.
She loves to sue.
She loves lawsuits.
You know, honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
You are so right.
You are so right! Because before I lived here, the glass was always covered in smudges.
And I moved in and I cleaned it, so I guess that makes me the devil.
You are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! - I'm burning.
Help me.
- You shouldn't joke about that.
- Is there more wine in the kitchen? - I will get it.
I will get it.
What kind of hostess would I be if - It's okay - No, no.
In fact, you know what? Girls' trip.
Angela, come on.
Girls' trip.
Oh, not even close.
So you keep a very tidy house.
You should see our bathroom after Michael takes a bath.
- But I don't need to tell you, Pam.
- Oh, yeah What? Oh, don't tell me that he's really changed since you guys dated.
Oh, are you joking? Michael told me a little bit about it, but I see the way you look at him.
I have never, ever dated or wanted to do anything resembling dating Michael, ever.
Not ever, not now, not then, not now, not ever, ever.
I've noticed how you look at him at the office.
So I spend most of my time right here.
Have a hand.
So, Jim, I noticed you checking out Jan's candles.
Oh, no, she just put it in front of my face.
Yeah Did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion a year industry.
And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan.
" - What do you think about that? - Thought about it.
I'm in.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company? I'm sorry.
What now? Coming.
Hello.
What are you doing here? We came here to eat dinner and to party.
This is a dinner party, right? - Awesome! - What is he doing here? - Yes, what are you doing here? - Dwight is friend.
We weren't invited? You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses.
Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Fine.
Whatever you want.
Just like always.
Whatever you want.
Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want.
- It's fine, Michael.
- When I wanted to see Stop and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see? We saw Wic When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said that you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then, when you said that you might wanna have kids, and I wasn't so sure, who had the vasectomy reversed? And when you said you definitely didn't want? Who had it reversed back? Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap! - I did! - Okay You have no idea the physical toll that three vasectomies have on a person! And I bought this condo - to fill with children.
- I am so sorry that I don't want to bring kids into this screwed-up world.
- Okay? But look - Sorry too.
If you want to have kids, then fine, you win.
Let's have a fuckin' kid! You mean it? You wanna have a kid? I hate my life.
So can we come in? Great turkey leg.
Okay, I'm just gonna check on dinner.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad? I hate beet salad.
It's actually really good.
I know you love beet salad.
I've seen you eat it many times.
The thought of popping one of your beets into my mouth makes me want to vomit.
Pam I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
Like what? I can't prove it, but I think she might be trying to poison me.
- Hey, looks great, babe.
- Yeah, it really does.
I know Jan didn't poison the food.
I know that.
But if she was going to poison the food of someone at that table, wouldn't it be me? Michael's former lover.
Can you not do that? It's disgusting.
You know I have soft teeth.
How could you say that? Excuse me for a second.
So How do you guys know each other? I was his babysitter.
And now you guys are dating? It's purely carnal, that's all you need to know.
Would you write down your email? Because I have just so many questions.
Email? Never mind.
All right.
There we go.
There.
- That's nice.
- Everybody enjoy their meal.
Hey, babe.
How'bout we take the beer sign down until our guests leave, and then we can discuss it? No I'm gonna leave it up.
I think it ties the whole room together.
Okay.
Jan thinks Hunter is very talented.
You know what? I don't think he's that good.
At least he's an artist.
B.
F.
D.
, I'm a screenwriter.
And I'm a candle maker, but you don't hear me braggin'about it! No, all you do is you get me to try to work on my rich friends.
For an investment opportunity! Man, I would love to burn your candles! You burn it, you buy it! Oh, good, I'll be your first customer! You're hardly my first.
That's what she said! That is a $200 plasma screen TV that you just killed! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe! - I'm gonna get going.
- Fine, get out of here.
It's getting late.
You know what, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
Of course.
Get out of my way.
I'll take care of this.
Okay, what seems to be the problem, officers? Not now, Dwight.
We got a call about a disturbance? No.
Nope.
Nothing disturbing here.
Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
Your neighbors heard shouting.
Yes, there was screaming, but My girlfriend threw a dundie at my TV.
A plasma.
- You want to press charges? - Would she get into trouble? Yeah, she'd be charged.
I will take the fall.
- I did it.
- You don't have to press charges.
You could just try to be more quiet.
- Michael! - Yes.
What what are you doing to him? Sir, do you have any other place you could stay? Maybe with one of your friends here? Michael can come home with me.
Jim, Pam? - Oh, my apartment's on fire.
- Flooded.
You people! - Come on, you're sleeping with me.
- No.
- I'm gonna take you home, Michael.
- No.
Come with me.
All right.
Bye, babe! This is the best burger I've ever had, babe.
Babe, I should have told you, but I did something bad.
I stole this.
For you, babe.

How would Luke Skywalker and Obi Wan Kenobi react If they saw some of the vile things posts in the comment section about other members? They'd be pretty disgusted with your behavior, I'll tell you that.[removed]I can't tell if I have a problem, or if I'm doing god's work. I can't stop saying bepis, it's gotten to a point where I call my corgi bepis so much that he thinks that's his name. To make matters worse, I got everyone saying it at my work, and I work at a law office; everyone will casually blurt it out randomly, as if they have Tourette's.

My wife can't stop saying it either, we'll see anything random and point at it and yell... well you know, the B word. I don't know if I need help, or if I should continue to manifest my destiny, which is getting everyone I get in contact with to start saying BEPIS.

Pls halp, wat do?To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand microtransactions. The intent is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Austrian economics most of the money will fly right out of a typical gamer’s wallet. There’s also EA’s opportunistic scheming, which is deftly woven into its monetization- its corporate philosophy draws heavily from Hobbesian literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the sense of pride and accomplishment, to realize that they’re not just looking at average per-player credit earn rates on a daily basis- they say something deep about challenges that are compelling, rewarding, and OF COURSE attainable via GAMEPLAY. 

As a consequence, people who dislike Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 truly ARE armchair developers- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in EA’s existential catchphrase “It's In The Game,” which itself is an ironic reference to Norah McClintock’s young adult novel Truth And Lies. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated nerf herders providing candid feedback in earnest as EA’s avarice unfolds itself on their computer screens. What sheep.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Star Wars™ Battlefront™ 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the Twi'leks’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 60,000 credits of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel armchair developer 😎Everyone knows you edited your post and anyone who manipulates cummy should be floggedTo quote Hamlet Act III Scene iii line 87, "No!".Is there? What's the big difference? I'm against pedophilia and I'm also against mislabeling everything as pedophilia.

We spend years trying to get people to understand that fiction is fiction so that we can carry on playing violent games. Yet as soon as there's a sexualised cartoon minor suddenly there's no difference, fiction is now just as bad as reality. Especially when you consider that most minors in anime are supposed to look older than they are. The few that are lolis rarely are actually sexualised beyond panty shots.

I watch anime and I know you'll just dismiss me as a pedo because that's what people like you do. But I know what's fiction and what's reality and I know I've never connected the two. I watch anime, and maybe I get a boner when a "14" year old girl moans because the MC accidentally groped her breasts. So what? I'm not going around IRL getting boners over 14 year olds because not only don't they look like anime girls, I'm just not attracted like any regular person.

Just the same as getting enjoyment out of gruesome murders in a game. I'm not about to go out and behead someone or ram my car into a crowd because I don't actually want to do it.Pussy Lickers and cunt fuckers, welcome aboard Bitch Nigga flight 6969 bound for Mufucking Palestine,  with continued service to Iraq international airport. All carry on items should now be stored tight. Either in an overhead bin or up your ass. All aisles, exits, and bulkhead areas should now be clear.

Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of eating lollipops with chiya and lying to papa about eating sugar. People say to me that a person being Johny is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded but to that I say, "no papa". I'm having a plastic surgeon shrink me down to the size of a baby, severely elongate my arms and make my head the size of a fucking beach ball.  From now on I want you guys to always follow my name with "doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and respect my right to If you can't accept me you're a Johnyphobe and need to check your papa privilege.

May GodBot bless 🙏🏼 you well. I 🤟🏼 will see 👀 you in heaven ☀️ my greatest son 👶🏻

With this, I bode 👋🏼 you adieu 😭Just because you're some inept basement dweller who was unable to compete on an athletic level when you were younger does not mean you can make any pathetic carpultunel inducing event a sport. You would be more likely to get jacking off to be considered a sport because you practice that multiple times a day and it makes you sweat...and cry.
 

Just because you and a few of your tubby friends take time off from eating hot pockets and talking shit about peoples mothers on WoW to watch 10 nerds slam the same 4 buttons of a keyboard over and over does not quantify said event as a sport. 
 

Please avoid further embarrassment by shutting up and keeping your shameful hobbies away from actual sports in the future.

Time is running out in 2016 to help Wikipedia. Do you want Wikipedia to be there when you need it? Today, tomorrow, and for years to come? If you do, our community needs your support. When I made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned me I’d regret it. Over a decade later, it’s the only top ten site run by a non-profit and a community of passionate volunteers. Has it crossed my mind how much money we could have made if it had ads? Sure. But I believe people wouldn’t want to build it and we wouldn't be able to trust it. To protect our independence, we'll never run ads. We're sustained by donations averaging about $15. Now is the time we ask. If everyone reading this right now gave $3, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. That's right, the price of a cup of coffee is all we need. Please help us keep Wikipedia online and growing.

Fuck literally everything about Reddit, constantly encouraging retards to post variations of these same 3 words on every goddamn post they see. You couldn't even bother to come up with replacements for "fake" and "gay", yet for some reason you're still sitting at the top of the comments.Again, I will tell you. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS HETEROSEXUALITY. It is simple a myth created by conservatives in Roman times to keep order. Any person that thinks they’re “heterosexual” simple has not tried to have sexual relations with someone of the same sex because it is taboo in today’s society. Heterosexuality is just a naughty word that promotes indigenous bigotry. i am a 15 years old and i am a teenager. i have a 10 inch peenis and i have sex with my girlfirend every day after school. i also masturbate 12 times a day and i have had sex with 100 girls. i smoke 10 pounds of weed every day at 4:20. i take high school math and i can count to infinity. my high school science teacher is really impressed with me because i know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell and ive taken sex ed 5 times already. i know a condom is used for and i use one every day. i also have infinity minecraft and roblox cheets and hacks i all made myself. i hang out at the mall with my 50 friends every day after having sex with my girlfirend who i met on roblox. and before you go, i do know what sex is. you put your peenis in her peehole and then pee.

Your ISPs will continue to make changes and monitor your internet activity to update everyone as soon and as often as we can.  I've been preparing for this. I remembered reading online that when alligators hear a low b flat they get ravenously horny. Ever since learning this I have been laying awake at night, fantasizing. The image of an alligator forcefully thrusting it's white, rubbery penis into my asshole, it's scales rough against ass and balls sends shivers of excitement and lust throughout my entire body. Today marks the beginning of the alligators mating season. It only cost me 20 dollars and a Kevlar vest for a tuba player from Craigslist to come out into the Everglades with me and continuously play a b flat for 20 minutes. 20 minutes should be more than enough.


  As we board the airboat, I feel my desire soaring. I want to touch myself to the thought of what will soon happen, but I withhold. I don't want to lose my appetite before it even begins. 

  We approach and beach on a small island in the middle of the swamplands. I get out and begin to strip. It is finally time. I get on my knees, bent over with my chest on the ground, so my asshole is readily accessable. I signal the tuba player to begin. He starts his stopwatch and begins to play a low B flat. For the first minute nothing happens. This is ok, they will come, I tell myself. As soon as I say this, i hear the unmistakeable sounds of an alligator slowly approaching. Unable to resist, I begin masturbating furiously. All my preparation has come down to this moment. The alligator cautiously approaches. It seems hesitant at first, poking it's snout against my ass, between my legs. It backs off for a second. Desperate, I tell the tuba player to play louder. He happily obliges. "20 bucks is 20 bucks, I'm not one to judge" he told me on the boat ride over. 

Finally, the alligator mounts me. The weight of his massive reptilian body nearly crushes me, but I manage to keep in position for optimal fucking.he begins to press his white rubbery penis against my asshole. I did not apply lube before hand, I want the alligator to have as much friction as he wants. Harder and harder he thrusts, my anus begins to tear. A small price to pay for such an amazing experience. Finally, with the help of the alligators precum, he is able to fully penetrate. He begins thrusting. Harder and harder he goes. His scales cut my ass, I don't care. My anus is being reduced to little more than a mangled and bloody hole. I don't mind. With his weight on me I can barley breathe. The pure ecstasy of the moment hits me with a final rush as his engorged member swells and bursts inside of me. I can no longer contain it and I cum as well. He remains inside of me for a moment, then slowly pulls out, his cum mixed with my blood dripping from his shrinking dick. As he slides back into the water, I collapse. I feel complete. 

On the boat ride back to dock, I slip the tuba player an extra tenner.HEY!!✊✊ Kids!!👦👧 Put Your👆👆Phone📱📱 Down!!!⬇⬇Did You Know??🤔🤔🤔That One 📚📚Study📚📰📚 Shows👀👀 That The ☢☢☡RADIATION☡☢☢😷😷😨😨😵😵 From 👆👆Your👆👆 📱📱Phone📱📱🛢Can☡!!DAMAGE!!☡👆Your👆 👀Eyes!👀!!!!

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈    The goldfish logo 'The snack that smiles back' implies that the goldfish cracker is sentient enough to not only understand that I am smiling, but it also has the facial muscles to copy and return the facial expression to me, all the while aware of it's impending fate of being eaten. Furthermore, this slogan implies that the people who create the goldfish crackers have dominion over artificial life and the ability to create it, all the while granting the sentient cracker edibility. Does this mean the people who make goldfish crackers are hinting that they have the key to life? And good nutritious Edible Yellow Fish?I sexually identify as a fidget spinner.  Ever since I was only raw plastic, I dreamed of continually spinning around my axis until greasy, autistic fingers stopped me. Normal people bully me, and say things like "what the fuck, you aren't a fidget spinner", but I know deep down they are just jealous of my magnetism. I have already started attaching magnets to myself, and now i'm improving my spinniness by regularly rotating on an axis with my magnetism. I want you guys to respect my natural ability to instantly satisfy the fidgeting of retarded children, and if you don't you're oppressing me, retarded children, and fidget spinners like me around the world, and you should check your center of magnetism.  Thank you for being so understanding.﻿Hi, you're on a rock, floating in space. Pretty cool, huh? Some of it's water. Fuck it, actually, most of it's water.

A long time ago... actually, never, and also now, nothing is nowhere. When? Never. Makes sense, right? Like I said, it didn't happen. Nothing was never anywhere. That's why it's been everywhere. It's been so everywhere, you don't need a "where". You don't even need a "when". That's how "every" it gets.

...

Forget this, I wanna be something, go somewhere, do something. I want things to change, I want to invent time and space, and I know it's possible because everything is here, and it probably already happened. I just don't know when to start... and that's exactly where it started.

Congratulations, THE WORLD IS NOW a bunch of gas in space... but it's getting closer together...

*<10 million years later>*

...and it's getting closer together...

*<500 million years later>*

...and it's getting closer toget-

New shit just got made! Some stars burn out and die. Bigger stars burn out and die with passion and make some brand new way crazier shit.

#S P A C E D U S T

...which allows for newer and more interesting stars to be made, and then die and explode into

#E V E N C R A Z I E R S P A C E D U S T

So now, stars have cool stuff around them, like rocks, ice and funny clouds, which can make some very interesting things. Like this ball of flaming rock, for example...

*<meteor hits Earth>*

Holy shit, we just got hit by another ball of flaming rocks, and it kind of... made a mess, which is

#N O W T H E M O O N

*Weather update!* It's raining rocks from outer space. *Weather update!* Those rocks might have had water inside of them and now there's hot steam in the sky. *Weather update!* Cooler temperatures today and the floor is no longer lava. *Weather update!* ...it's raining. *Severe flooding alert!* The entire world is now an ocean. *Volcano alert!*

#T H A T 'S L A N D !

^^^there's ^^^life ^^^in ^^^the ^^^ocean.

What?

#S O M E T H I N G ' S A L I V E I N T H E O C E A N

Oh, cool! Like, a plant or an animal? No, a microscopic speck! It lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup, which is being served hot and fresh, made from *gnarly space ingredients* left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever...

*<microscopic speck reproduces asexually>*

Oh yeah, and it can do that.

*<microscopic specks reproduce asexually three more times>*

It has secret instructions written inside itself, telling it how to build another one of itself. So, that's pretty nifty, I would say. Tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?

#N O W Y O U C A N E A T S U N L I G H T

*"Using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into food."*

#T A S T E T H E S U N

Side effect: Now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky is blue. Then the Earth might have been a snowball for a while, maybe even a couple of times.

It's a sponge, it's a plant, it's a worm, and some other types of weird, stranger water bugs and strange fish.

#I T ' S T H E C A M B R I A N E X P L O S I O N

Wow, that's animals and stuff, but we're still in the ocean. "Hey, can we go on land?"

#N O

"Why?"

#T H E S U N I S A D E A D L Y L A Z E R

"Oh, okay."

*<ozone layer forms>*

#N O T A N Y M O R E T H E R E ' S A B L A N K E T

Now the animals can go on land. Come on animals, let's go on land! "Nope, can't walk yet, and there's no food yet, so I don't care."

*<100 million years later>*

Okay, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here? "Maybe," said some bugs, and fish.

"Eh."

"Eh."

"Eh."

*<five million years later>*

"Okay, so I can go on land, but I have to go back in the water to

#H A V E B A B I E S

Idea: Learn to use an egg. "I was already doing that!" Use a stronger egg, put water in it, have a baby on land, in an egg. Water is in the egg. Baby, in the egg, in the water, in the egg. "Works for me."

#B Y E B Y E O C E A N

*<50 million years later>*

And now everything's huge, including bugs. Wanna see a map of the land? Sure.

*<Permian extinction>*

Oh, fuck, now everything's dead. Just kidding, here are the survivors. Keep your eye on this one, because it's about to become...

*<75 million years later>*

...the dinosaurs. Here's another map of the land. Yeah, it broke apart. Don't worry about it, does that all the time. Here comes a meteor.

*<boom>*

#A N D T H E D I N O S A U R S A R E G O N E

It's mammal time, here come the mammals. Look at those breasts. Now they're gonna dominate the world, but one of them just learned how to grab stuff and walk. No, like, walk like that, and grab stuff at the same time, and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.

"Ouch."

And set things on fire.

"Yeouch."

And make crazy sounds with their voice.

"Gneurshk."

Which can mean different things.

#T H A T ' S A H U M A N P E R S O N

And now they're everywhere...almost.

#I C E A G E

What? You can walk over here? Cool!

#N O T A N Y M O R E

Well, I guess we're stuck here. Let's review: There's people on the planet, and they're chasing their food. "Fuck it, time to plant some grass. Look at this, I get to control the food now. Now, everyone will want to be my friend and live near me. Let's all build houses, except mine is bigger because I own the food." This is great! I wonder if anyone else is doing this?

Tired of using rocks for everything? Use metal! It's underground. Better farming was just invented in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers, and the animals are helping.

#G U E S S W H A T H A P P E N S N E X T ?

More food, and more people who came to buy the food. Now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales, and now you need house for people to live in and people to make the houses and now there's more people to make more things for more people and now there's business, money, writing, laws, power.

#S O C I E T Y

Coming soon to a dank river valley near you! Meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, the horse is probably being tamed.

Why is all my metal so lame and lumpy? Tired of using lame, sad metal? Introducing:

Made from special ingredient: Tin, from the far lands of Tin Land. I don't know, my dealer won't tell me where he gets it. Also, guess what?

Meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, they figured out how to put wheels on a horse. Now we're getting somewhere. Also...

*<Society count: 5 ... Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Indus Valley Civilization, Norte Chico>*

#N O R T E C H I C O

The Middle East is getting more complicated. Maybe because it's in the middle of the East. Knock knock, er, clop clop, it's the people with the... horses, and they made an empire, and then everyone else copied their horses.

#G R E E K S

Ah, look, it must be the Greeks... er, a beta version of the Greeks. Let's check in with the Indus River Valley Civilization... they're gone. Guess who's not gone?

There's the Bronze Age collapse.

Also, can we switch to a metal that's a little easier to find? Thanks. Look who came back to Israel: It's the twelve tribes of Israel.

Just one, though. He's got, like, a ten step program.

Here's some huge heads, must be the Olmecs. The Phoenicians make some colonies. The Greeks copy their idea and make some colonies. The Phoenicians made a colony so big it makes colonies. Here comes the Assyrian Empire. Never mind, it's the Babyloni- Media-

#I T ' S T H E P E R S I A N E M P I R E

Wow, that's big.

*<ding>*

Ah, the Buddha was just enlightened! "Who's the Buddha?" This guy, who sat under a tree for so long that he figured out how to ignore the fact that we're all dying. You could make a religion out of this!

Oops, China just broke, but while it was breaking, Confucius was figuring out how to have good morals.

Ah, the Greeks just had the idea of thinking about stuff, and right over here, Alexander just had the idea of conquering the entire Persian Empire. It's a great idea, he was great... and now he's dead. Hopefully the rest of the gang will be able to share the empire evenly between them.

Knock knock, it's Chandragupta. He says "Get the hell out of here. Will you get the hell out of here if I give you 500 elephants? Okay, thanks, bye."

#T I M E T O C O N Q U E R A L L O F I N D I A

Or...

#M O S T O F I N D I A

But what about this part? That's the Tamil Kings, no-one conquers the Tamil Kings. Who are the Tamil Kings?

#M E R C H A N T S P R O B A B L Y A N D T H E Y ' V E G O T S P I C E S

"Who would like to buy the spices?" "Me!" said the Arabians, swiftly buying it and selling it to the rest of the world.

Hey, China put itself back together again, with good morals as their main philosophy. Actually, they have three main philosophies.

*<Confucianism: Have good morals>*

*<Taoism: Go with the flow>*

*<Legalism: Fuck you, obey the law>*

Out here, the horse nomads run wild and free, and they would like to ransack your city.

*<ransacking intensifies>*

Let's check the Greekification levels of the Greekified kingdoms. GREEKIFICATION OVERLOAD! "Bye," said the Parthians. "Bye," said the Jews. "Hi," said the Parthians, taking over the entire place. "Heeeeey" said the Romans, eating the entire Mediterranean for breakfast. "Thanks for invading our homeland," said the Jews, who were starting to get tired of people invading their homeland.

"Hi, everything's great," said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular, which actually makes him more popular. You could make a religion out of this!

Want silk? Now you can buy it from China. They just made a

Or you can

#G E T T H E R E O N W A T E R

"Sick! New trade routes!" said India, accidentally spreading their religion to the entire southeast. Hmm, that's a good place for an epic trading kingdom.

There goes Buddhism, travelling up the Silk Road. I wonder if it will reach China before it collapses again?

*<China breaks>*

Remember the Persian Empire? "Yep," said the Persians, making a new one. Axum is getting so powerful, they would like to build a long stick. Has anyone populated Madagascar yet? Let's do it together!

There's the Gupta Empire, not Chandragupta, just Gupta... first name Chandra... the First.

Guess who's in Rome?

#B A R B A R I A N S

What's a barbarian? "Non-Romans," said the Romans, being invaded by non-Romans. R.I.P. Roman Empire... actually, just half of it, the other half is just fine, but it's not in Rome anymore, so let's give it a new name.

#T H E M A Y A N S H A V E F I G U R E D O U T T H E S T A R S

Oh, and here's a huge city. Population: Everyone. The Göktürks have taken over the entire Eurasian steppe. Great job, Göktürks. How's India? Broken. How's China?

#B A C K T O G E T H E R

How's those trading kingdoms?

#B I G G E R A N D T H E R E ' S M O R E O F T H E M

Korea has three kingdoms. Japan has a kingdom, it's the Sunrise Kingdom.

Deep in the Arabian desert, on the top of a mountain, the real God whispers in Muhammad's ear. So, he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and tells them their gods are all fake, and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town. You could make a religion out of this, and maybe conquer the world as well.

The Roman empire is long gone, but somehow, the Pope is still the Pope. Plus, there's

"Let's bring stuff to the coast and sell it, and become the Swahili on the Swahili Coast," said the Swahili on the Swahili Coast.

Remember this tiny space you have to go through to get from here to there? Someone owns that now!

Wanna get enlightened in the middle of nowhere?

The Franks have the biggest kingdom in Europe, and the Pope is so proud that he invites the King over for Christmas. "Surprise! You're the new Roman Emperor!" said the Pope, pretending to still be part of the Roman Empire. Then, the Franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called France and not-France.

The Northerners, or just "Norse" if you don't have much time, are exploring. They go north, from the north to the northern north, and they find some land. Two types of land, and they name them accordingly.

#*<P R A N K D>*

They also invade some other places and get called many names, such as "Vikings". There's the Rus, the Kievan Rus. Are they Vikings? "I don't think so," said the Kievan Rus. Okay, fair enough.

The Pope is ready to make some more emperors of the Roman Empire: The Holy Roman Empire. It's actually Germany, but don't worry about it.

New kingdoms!

"Aah!" said the Byzantine Empire, who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore. "We need help!" They need help, so they call the Pope. "Hey Pope, can you help us get rid of the Seljuks, maybe take back the Holy Land on the way? C'mon, I know you want to take back the Holy Land." "Yes, I do actually want to do that. Let's do a Crusade."

#C R U S A D E

They did many Crusades, some of which almost didn't fail, but at least the Italians got some sweet trade deals.

Look at those mounds.

There's the Pueblo. I always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.

Guess who's here? Khmer. Where? Here, and Pagan is there. Vietnam unconquered itself, Korea just became itself, and Japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government. China just invented bombs and typing, and the Mongols just invaded most of the Universe. Nice going, Genghis! I bet that will last a long time.

*<Mongolian empire breaks>*

Some of the Islamic Turks were unaffected by the Mongol invasions because they were busy invading India.

Is it Tonga time? I think it's Tonga time.

The King of Mali is so rich, he's going on tour to let everyone know. "Wow, that guy's rich," everyone said.

The Christians are doing a great job reconquering Iberia, which will soon be called Spain and not-Spain. Please remain Christian, we will check in later to see if you are still Christian when you least expect it.

Whoops, half of Europe just died.

China's back, yay!

Hey, Khmer, time to share. New kingdoms, here and there. Oh, look who controls all the islands, it's the Mahajapit.

Oh, Italy's really rich, time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics. It's kinda like a rebirth. Here's a printer, let's make books!

*So you think you can conquer the Byzantine Empire?* "Yep," said the Ottoman Turks. Nice job, Ottoman Turks. Oops, you missed a spot. Don't forget to ban Europe from the Indian spice trade. "What? That's bullshit!" said Portugal, spiceless.

#W E L L I G U E S S W E ' L L H A V E T O F I N D A N O T H E R W A Y T O I N D I A

"Wait!" said Christopher Columbus, probably smoking crack. "If the world is round, let's go this way to India!" "Nah, don't worry, we already got this," said Portugal. So, Chris goes to Spain. "Hey Spain, wanna hire me to find India by going around back of the world?"

"No."

"Please?"

"No."

"Please?"

"No." ^^^"wtf"

"Please?"

"...okay."

So he sails into the ocean and discovers... more ocean, and then discovers the Indies and Japan! Let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.

The Aztec and Inca empires are off to a great start. I wonder if they know that Europe just discovered their continent.

The Habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families, they might have to start marrying each other.

Move over, Lithuania, here comes Moscow. Ivan wants to make Russia great again. Move over, Timurids, maybe go invade India or something. Persia just made Persia Persian again. Let's make it the other kind of Islam, the one where we thought the first guy should've been the other guy.

"Hey Christians, do you sin? Now you can buy your way out of Hell!" "That's bullshit, this whole thing is bullshit, that's a scam, fuck the Church, here's 95 reasons why," said Martin Luther, in his new book which might have accidentally started the Protestant Reformation.

"You know what would be magnificent?" said Suleiman, wearing an onion hat. "What if the Ottoman Empire was... really big?" which it is now. "What if Russia was big?" said Ivan, trying not to be terrible.

Portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire Indian Ocean, including the spice trade, and then that dream was real. And Spain realized that this is not India, but they pillaged it anyway. "Damn," said England and France, "we gotta start pillaging some stuff." Then the Dutch revolt, and all the hipsters moved to Amsterdam. "Damn," said Amsterdam, "...we gotta start pillaging some stuff."

Question one: Can you get to India through North America? No, but at least there's beaver. Question two: Steal the spice trade. That's not a question, but the Dutch did it anyway.

#S U G A R

Guess where all the sugar is made? In Brazil... stolen! In the Caribbean, and it's so goddamn profitable, you might forget to not do slavery.

The next thing on Russia's to-do list is to get bigger.

Britain and France are having a friendly discussion about who should control the world, more specifically, Ohio. Then, it escalates into a seven-year discussion, giving Prussia a chance to show Austria who's boss. But, what about Britain and France, did they figure out who's boss? Yes, they did, it's Britain. Guess who's broke? Also Britain. So, they start taxing the hell out of America. "Fuck you!" said America, declaring their independence and fighting for it, and France helps them win. Now, France is broke, and Britain will have to send their prisoners to a different continent.

Wait, if France is broke, why do the King and Queen still wear such fancy dresses? "Let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off!" said Robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off. You can make a reli-

No, don't.

Haiti is starting to like the idea of a revolution, especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters. "Why didn't we think of this before?"

Wait, who's in charge of France now?

Said Napoleon, trying to take over Europe. Luckily, they banished him to an island.

#B U T H E C A M E B A C K

Luckily, they banished him to another island.

There goes Latin America, becoming independent in the Latin American wars of independence.

Britain just figured out how to turn steam into power, so now they can make

Then they invent some trains and conquer India, and maybe put some trains there. "Hey, China!" said Britain, "buy stuff from us!" "Nah dude, we already got everything," says China, so Britain tried to get them addicted to opium, which worked actually, but then China made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea, so Britain threw a hissy fit and made them open up five cities and give them an island.

Britain and Russia are playing a game where they try to stop the other person from conquering Afghanistan. Also,

The United States finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad. It's bad, they decided, and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the Mexicans too.

"I know, let's rape Africa!" said Europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.

*<U.S.S. Maine sinks>*

"Let's blame the Maine on Spain." So they blame the Maine on Spain. Now we're in business. To celebrate, they kick Panama out of Panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.

Britain just found oil in the Middle East.

China is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government... which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.

Europe hasn't had a war since the last war, so they start World War One. Look at those guns! It's gonna be a great war, so great we won't need a second one. After it's over, they blame Germany.

Russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government, now everyone's paycheck is the same.

"Hello?" "Yes, it's the 1920's calling. Let's get in a car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies! The economy is great and it will probably be great forever... just kidding."

Germany's back, featuring Hitler, the angry mustache model, and he's mad at the Jews for existing.

Japan is finally conquering the East, and they're so excited, they rape Nanking way too hard. They should probably just deny it.

Hitler's out of control, so the international community tackles him and tries to explain to him why killing all the Jews is a bad idea, but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

There's the Korean War, Korea vs. Korea! Nobody wins, then it's on pause forever. Let's meet the sponsors. Oh, it's the two global superpowers. They're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good and which one is an evil virus of Satan.

And they both have atom bombs.

FIGHT!

Wait, no, that would be the end of the world. Let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead... and make sure we have enough atom bombs. "I'll race you to space!"

*<Russia puts a satellite in orbit>*

*<United States puts a flag on the moon>*

Now let's make some more countries fight themselves.

Europe is tired of pillaging other continents, and the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged, so here's a new map with new countries. Now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.

The United States finally decided whether racism is good or bad. They decided it's bad and the world agrees. South Africa might need another minute to think about it.

Let's check the world population!

*<huge exponential rise>*

Woah.

Okay.

Technology's better too, that might keep happening.

The Soviet Union decides to relax a little and accidentally falls apart.

Europe makes a union so now they can all use the same money, except Britain, because they don't feel like it.

Let's check the mail. Surprise, it's on the computer!

Whoops, someone just attacked America, I bet they'll remember that.

Phone call. Surprise, it's in your pocket! Wanna learn everything? Surprise, it's on the computer! Now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket!

Whoops, the economy just crashed. Don't worry, the big banks won't fail, because they're not supposed to.

Surprise! Flying robots... with bombs!

*<bin Laden gets bombed>*

*Wanna print a brain?*

Some people have no friends. Some people have no food. The globe is warming.

"Let's save the planet!" said everybody, not knowing how.

"Let's invent a thing inventor," said the thing inventor inventor after being invented by a thing inventor. That's pretty cool.

By the way, where the hell are we?

#*THANKS FOR WATCHING HISTORY*

#*I HOPE I MENTIONED EVERYTHING*I fucking hate you all. You're all a bunch of useless, autistic weaboo cunts. All you do all day is masturbate your fucking short dick, watch shitty Japanese cartoons and post nonsense on this stupid god damned board. What is this board even for? Have you seen the shit these retards post here? Its all post humor hipster nonsense. Why can’t you just laugh at shit normal people find funny? Why do you feel the need to be so fucking different and unique that you have to come to this stupid fucking website for your kicks? Is it because you didn’t have any friends in school? Is that it? You can’t just go on Facebook and lnstagram and look at your dumb memes like everyone else, oh no, that would make you a “normie.” So instead you come here of all places, to unload your unfunny trash onto the internet and circle jerk your dumb buddies cocks off. You make me sick. Reply this post or your mother will die in her sleep tonight.All over the internet, I notice you churlish cretins lauding the supposedly intellectual television program known as Rick and Morty to make yourselves appear more intelligent by extension, as you are ardent watchers of the aforementioned show. However, you piddling planarians only succeed in illustrating how vapid you really are, as Rick and Morty has the intellectual depth of a petri dish. Truly, the most noetic show is neither Rick and Morty, the Big Bang Theory, Jimmy Neutron, nor any other deluge of drivel you deludable dimwits bombard your brains with. Rather, it is Johnny Test, a pinnacle of animation, sound design, acting, and plot. Despite this, most of you sniveling sub-10000s (someone with an IQ under 10000: for the record, my IQ is several orders of magnitude higher than this; my reason for my usage of this term is simply because I am partial to the number 10000) will dismiss Johnny Test as another subpar piece of rubbish from Teletoon, but you all fail to realize how much genius goes into producing that show. I have watched Johnny Test since I was a juvenile, and already I bear an IQ so toweringly high no known test can measure it (that is to say, no known test for humans can measure it: when using the scale with which computer processing power is evaluated, I clock in at over 8.3 trecentillion yottaflops). I have memorized every facet of human knowledge and only used 32.8% of my potential intelligence (my remaining neurons I allocate towards personal use, research, and wealthy companies for use as server farms and bitcoin mines). Not only that, but I have transformed all of the atoms in my being into a quantum computer to serve as an extension to my enormous encephalon, which handles the menial tasks and other trivialities associated with existence (such as respiration, ingestion, digestion, socializing, et cetera). Capable of perorating proficiently in every method of communication in the world, I have developed my own language that employs a manifold of grammar rules, and I created it all while thrashing a coalition of humanity’s smartest supercomputers in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe (for those who say that Tic-Tac-Toe is “easy,” think about the all the times you’ve played Tic-Tac-Toe: a majority were ties, no? Think about that, and also about the fact that a single, solitary supercomputer, much less over a dozen, is smarter than millions of you combined). And no, you cannot see me type this language because it is purely telepathic. At this point, I can imagine several of you already typing frantically in a fervent effort to keep your egos afloat in the face of such psychological grandeur. That’s right, the collective intelligence of all of you, if we’re using luminosity as an analogy, is akin to a diminutive candle in comparison to the massive quasar that represents my mind. Confronted with this, most of you will attempt to deride me with paltry, nonsensical invective and vitriolic vituperations to protect what minuscule amount of self-esteem you possess. These predictions are not the result of mere intuition, of course. In actuality, I have run several simulations using my brain alone on the possible consequences of my publication of this digital manuscription. My reply to all of you digital detractors is that if you so desire to demonstrate that you are brainier than I, then arrange for an intellectual debate between you and me on a topic of your choosing, any time or place. My schedule is very pliable as I’ve already won over 4 dozen nobel prizes, so I’m perfectly willing to put a temporary halt to my research, if you could even call it that (I speculate without demur that none of your debate skills will be enough of a problem for me to the point where I will be forced to snap out out of my subconscious simulations to employ the use of those neurons). Besides, I don’t want to be a glory hog and leave none of the secrets of the universe left for unlocking. You know, let the dogs have their day and all of that. I already know that none of you simpletons with your senescent synapses will be able to match up to my vast vernacular and verbiage, my mental dexterity with declension, and my phrenic puissance with my phraseology and pronunciation. In a matter of seconds (or possibly longer, if I’ve overestimated your already positively benthic IQs when running my simulations), you’ll fly into cantankerous conniptions after my consummate trouncing and repudiation of every single one of the “facts” that you hold so dear as proof of your purported intellect. And in response to those who claim, overcome with envy and spite, that as intelligent as I am, I will never sleep with anyone: I don’t need to. I am quite capable of simulating, to the meagerest tactile sensation, every position in the Kama Sutra (as well as a few I myself have devised for maximum oxytocin and endorphin release) simultaneously in a few seconds, and the only reason it takes even that long is because I am prolonging the simulation in order to enjoy the experience: I could do it in hundredths of a millisecond if I so wish. However, for someone with such acute acumen as I, life is far too easy. When pure ennui drives you to calculate the movements of the 27 subatomic particles you’ve discovered and how they interact with one another in the 2,038th dimension using a base 3.2407 quadrillion number system, you realize that the universe and its infinite copies and offshoots offer nothing more to you. Except, that is, for Johnny Test. Even for an individual with such altitudinous IQ such as myself, it’s difficult to understand every single subtle joke and reference. That’s not to say I don’t understand any of the plenitude of allusions, in fact, I am able to comprehend virtually every single one. For example, one minutia most of you would fail to notice is when Susan’s chin moves two extra pixels further than in any of the previous episodes when she talks during the seventeenth second of the fifth minute of season 3 episode 10. Hardly any of you would conceive of the fact that this is a reference to the exact number, down to 84 significant figures, of the percent change in total nitrogen in the Earth’s atmosphere due to the eructation of a small cynodont 257 million years ago. There are more examples I could give, such as the color of the walls of the sisters’ lab being a slightly different hue from the norm in season 4 episode 19 (a reference to the presence of approximately 2.9 millimoles of ammonium diuranate in the ink of a Chinese manuscript dated 1256 BCE), but that would detract from the intended purpose of this writing. Johnny Test is a work of art, a perfect concoction of knowledge from a multitude of academic fields that combine to make a program that is the only form of media I have ever encountered that has been even somewhat laborious for me to fathom, and I’m talking about someone who altered the biochemistry and chirality of their body in order to make it more efficient than the prodigality that is the human body. My temples ache with the pain of having to pump copious amounts of Testium (an element I discovered that takes the role of oxygen in my unique biochemistry, named after my favorite show of course) to my brain in order to comprehend what I have just watched. And to everybody who claims that the reason my temples are sore or why I have “delusions of grandeur” are due to my being “high” or whichever way you aim to construe my exegesis of an episode, you will hear vocalizations of a gelatological nature emanating from my larynx whilst Xyzyzyx the paisley pangolin (a treasured acquaintance of mine) and I reflect on your foolishness later that day. I await the furious fussilade of odious obluquies and belittling bombast in the comments below. “Too long; Did not read”: Did you really think I would include one of these silly little things at the bottom of my witty wordsmithery? It's not my fault if you can't handle my de trop of definitions or my lexical linguipotence! Get back up there and read it, even if you have to go through it with dictionary in hand.
Gary, jetzt weiß ich, dass ich falsch lag Ich habe versaut und jetzt bist du weg Gary, es tut mir leid, dass ich dich vernachlässigt habe Oh, ich hätte nie erwartet, dass du wegläufst Und lass mich das leer fühlen Dein Miau würde jetzt wie Musik für mich klingen. Bitte komm nach Hause, denn ich vermisse dich, Gary. Gary, komm nach Hause. Gary, komm nach Hause Gary, komm nach Hause Gary, kannst du nicht sehen, dass ich blind bin? Ich werde alles tun, um deine Meinung zu ändern Mehr als ein Haustier, du bist mein bester Freund Zu cool, um zu vergessen, komm zurück, weil wir Familie sind Und verzeih mir, dass du dich herumtreiben willst

I would never suggest removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples. Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke. I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours. It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she murmurs breathlessly, then her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside again.Ben Shapiro TRIGGERS Liberal by SENDING them to NAZI DEATH CAMPS using pure CONSERVATIVE LOGIC and REASONING and then ANGERS SJW by GOING on a RAMPAGE literally RAPING and MURDERING every single MINORITY within a 200 MILE RADIUS then TROLLS Libtard with TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME by licking Donald Trumps MICROPENIS of all the DRIED CUM from the CONCEPTION of Barron Trump and he ANGERS democrat by FEEDING upon the FLESH of ABORTED FETUSES and the BLOOD of EVERY single LIBTARD to literally BECOME a GOD AMONG MEN which TROLLS idiot COMMIES by OPENING the seals of HELL and CAUSING the APOCALYPSE in which the DEVIL RAPES CHILDREN and TEARS OFF the heads of Liberal TODDLERS and LITERALLY setting WOMEN’s RIGHTS a THOUSAND YEARS and also Ben TRIGGERS the SOCIALISTS by RAPING the UNDEAD CORPSE of LEON TROTSKY and JOSEPH STALIN and he PISSES OFF the LEFTISTS by ESTABLISHING a NEW WORLD ORDER in which he is the SUPREME GOD EMPEROR OF ALL OF THE AMERICAS, CHINA, EUROPE, BRITAIN, TAIWAN, and THAT RANDOM ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN and MURDERS all POLITICAL DISSIDENTS within the government and then he LITERALLY summons CTHULHU and have home and the DEVIL FUCK HIM IN THE ASS while he CUMS all OVER the BOTTLE of LIBERAL TEARS and then he PRANKS Chink Ugayer by IMITATING him and literally dying from the ANAL WOUNDS from Literally being FUCKED IN THE ASS by SATAN and CTHULHU and then ENRAGES the COMMIES by RAPING GOD and BECOMING the NEW ABSOLUTE RULER OF THE UNIVERSE!!!!!

One thing I've learned after 21 years - you never know WHAT is gonna come through that door.Don't you fucking dare talking shit about Undertale, you fucking idiot.

You surely are a crybaby hippie hipster hater that likes to shit on popular things to be edgy. Guess what, dumbass? Undertale is the best game! And if you disagree you are simply ignorant. I bet you are a fucking normie that thinks Halo is better. Fuck you.

I used to be ignorant, too, not much of a gamer until I discovered the glory of Undertale. The characters, the plot, the humor, the gameplay, the music. It was simply perfect. It touched my heart and changed my life...

I've tried other so called "good" games like earthbound, zelda, yume nikki, off, but they all suck, they are all horrible pieces of shit compared to Undertale. Toby Fox is the God of videogames and Undertale is the masterpiece of humanity that all gamers should bow down to.

(399m). It was not my personal best (which is 407m) but it was still pretty impressive because I wasn't really trying at that moment. All my internet friends think I'm lying but what they know am I right? I once posted a dirty NoSc in fortnite reddit (website full of fortnite pros incase you are a n00b) and they gave me like 200 "upvotes". I don't consider myself as a pro but I'm definitely better than 80% of the community. So my question is that why my retarded friends online don't believe me? I'm like winning almost every match but every time I tell them that I've hit some uber long range headshots they don't believe me. Sometimes they even say that I'm cheating but I can't make myself bad at this game because it just happens to be really easy for a real gamer like me... 

The rain thrummed on the roof of the pickup. Rivulets zig-zagged down the windshield, casting odd patterns of light and shadows as the flickering light from the streetlight filtered into the cab. The smell of fast food lingered thick in the air, soon to be joined with the familiar stench of tobacco as Papa fumbled with his lighter at the tip of a cigarette. Johnny stared out the window, quietly sipping his soda.

"Why does she do that?" Johnny finally asked. "Why does she... get mad like that?"

Papa shook his head, the ember of the cigarette following along lazily. "Don't know," he said. "She just... Sometimes she turns into her mother."

Johnny didn't know what that meant. Didn't really *want* to know what that meant. The woman his father married was a stranger to him, and would probably always remain so. 

"You're gettin' behind in your schoolwork," Papa said. "I'm getting calls from the office. They say you aren't even there half the time."

Johnny's fist clenched. Of course he was behind. *Every* kid put in his position would be behind. The surge of despair and anguish welled up inside, threatening to burst forth... But he held it down. Like always, he held it down. He felt that if he allowed it out, it would be free to go on a rampage, destroying everything in sight.

Papa looked towards his son. "You got anything to say to that? Anything at all?"

Johnny had things to say. He had a lot to say. But he didn't. 

Papa turned to look out his window. But as he did so, Johnny noticed something. His eyes were bloodshot, his face flush. 

"Papa," Johnny said, "have you been going to meetings?"

Papa jerked his head back towards his son with a start. "What meetings?" he growled.

Johnny rolled his eyes before he could stop himself. "*Your* meetings, pops. In the basement of the church. With other people who have your... condition."

Papa's gaze was steady and even. "Every other night," he said quietly. "Just like I been doin' for four years. Every other damn night."

Before he even finished, Johnny was shaking his head. "Papa. No. Stop. I went to the meeting yesterday. And the day before that, and the day before that. You weren't there. Richard was asking about you."

The leather on the steering wheel squeaked as Papa's grip tightened. "Can't believe you, Johnny. I can't fucking believe you."

Johnny threw his hands up in surrender and turned to look out the passenger window. There was no sense in arguing with the old man. He didn't even want to be here in this truck, grabbing food at 9 pm to get away from that... that woman. Papa's *wife.*

But Papa had not averted his gaze from his son. "Johnny, Johnny," he said.

"Yes Papa?" Johnny answered without even realizing what he was doing. It was automatic now, after all these years of reciting the nursery rhyme with his old man.

But something creeped into Papa's voice that Johnny didn't like. "Eating *sugar?*"  the old man said.

Johnny's heart stopped as he realized what his father meant. That's what the kids were calling it these days, *eating sugar.* Puffing the gigglebush. 420 friendly. Down with the perpetual lol. Johnny had been doing that, had been doing a *lot* of that, but if his father found out... "No, papa," he said.

"Telling lies?"

"N-no papa..."

Papa leaned in, and for the first time, Johnny smelled the rotten stench of whiskey on his breath. "Open your mouth," he whispered.

Johnny wanted to keep his mouth closed, wanted to resist, but that would absolutely give him away. Maybe it's been long enough. Maybe he'll be lucky. He tried to look away from his father as he whispered "Ha, ha, haaaa..."

And then, joining the melody of fast food, and old upholstery, and tobacco, and whiskey, was the sweet stink of of *cannabis indica.*

Papa began nodding. He continued nodding even as Johnny protested, as if he finally understood, as if a piece of the puzzle had finally fallen into place. "Papa-- Daddy-- *please*--"

"You've been living in *my* house," the old man said steadily.

"I needed some way to cope. It's only been a year. I just needed a little help--"

"Eating *my* food."

"I'll stop now, I'll never pick it up again--"

"And using *my* electricity that I paid for with *my* paycheck."

"BECAUSE I'M YOUR SON!" Johnny screamed.

Papa shook his head. "No. No son of mine is a druggie. You know what mom and I have said about drugs."

"THAT WOMAN IS NOT MY MOM!!!" Johnny slammed his fists into the dashboard. "She's not even my STEP-mom! She's just a stupid woman!"

Papa's eyes narrowed. "Johnny, I'm warnin' you--"

"A year! A year, dad! Mom died and all it took you was a year to find some old bag to slap a ring on!"

"Johnny. Stop. Please."

"No wonder you picked up the bottle again, I'd be a drunk too if I had to share a bed with that whore!"

Papa lurched towards Johnny, and for one horrifying moment Johnny was sure he was going to get hit. Instead, Papa's arm flashed past him and opened the passenger side door. "Get out."

The cool night air and sweet smell of rain rolled in, gently pushing aside the tobacco and whiskey that had been infecting the cab. Johnny blinked in surprise. "Where do I go?"he asked.

"Not here," Papa said hoarsely. "Not home. Not anymore."

Johnny sat still, bewildered. "It... it's raining."

Papa sighed and looked away. "There's a homeless mission. Three blocks up the way. Across from the Methodist place. They'll take you in. I'll put your clothes out on the doorstep tomorrow. Your nice clothes. That way you can find a job."

Johnny unbuckled. "And just what the hell do you expect me to do about highschool?"

"Get a fuckin' GED," Papa snarled. "Just like I did. When my pappy kicked me out. I was 17 like you and I turned out fine. Just fucking fine."

Trying to control the rage building inside his chest, Johnny stepped into the softly falling rain. He turned to walk away, from his old man and his old life, but froze when he remembered... "What about Lilly?" he asked.

"What about Lilly?" Papa responded.

"I know how she is," Johnny said. "She'll miss me. She'll miss her big brother. She'll cry every night."

Papa's face was etched in stone, stoic except for the dumb, drunken sheen in his eyes. "She already does that," he said. "She already cries every night. Your mother-- your *real* mother-- made damn sure of that."

Johnny screamed and slammed the door. He walked away fast, as fast as he could, because if he didn't he was going to kill the old man. 

Papa watched as the silhouette of his son faded into the fog and the rain. He was gone. And Papa knew that he would probably never see him again. He sighed and popped open the glove box. He removed the revolver that he had brought along for such an occasion as this. There were six cylinders, but he had loaded only one. A couple times a week or so-- though it was becoming more and more frequent-- Papa liked to try his luck. There was about a 17 percent chance that there would be an existence-ending bang instead of a hollow click, and those odds got ever greater with every spin of the cylinder.

Papa gave it a good spin, put it against his temple, and watched to see if his luck would hold again tonight.I'm Papa John and this is my pizza restaurant.

The whole Brawl is shit because it isn't competitive tripe.

No.

Brawl is better than Melee, you confused children.

Period. It has more characters, more content, an extensive soundtrack with many orchestrated pieces, including the main theme which was wonderful, and so much more. It's the first game that allowed Mario and Sonic to beat the shit out of each other, and it had Solid fucking Snake. Not to mention Subspace Emissary, am I the only fucking person on this planet who was overjoyed to see Nintendo characters going on this big crossover adventure in these fucking awesome cutscenes? Brawl was a fucking ride for me, I've poured countless hours into it, but these days, this competitive community drives Brawl into the ground because "lol gay tripping" and "waaah not fast enough" and "booo no shitty wavecheating".

Listen to me, you sacks of shit.

Super Smash Bros is a party game series.

I really love and respect how you guys turned this game into something it was never meant to be, and it's beautiful. But you are the most toxic community I have ever seen. Your influence over the game had spread like a disease. I'm tired of being ridiculed for using items. I love items. I'm tired of people not wanting to play stages with stage hazards. I'm fucking sick of not being able to use my favorite character without hearing 'oh he's low tier'.

These things were put into the game

so you could fucking U S E them.

There is nothing wrong with liking Melee more than Brawl, hell there's nothing wrong with just not liking Brawl, but Brawl isn't shit just because it's not competitive enough, because news flash you 5 foot clitorus: This isn't street fighter. The point isn't to be competitive. The point is it being fun. The point is a bunch of characters from different games that we all grew up playing as and love getting together to beat the shit out of each other. Melee is superior to 64 only. Just as Brawl is superior to Melee, and Sm4sh is superior to Brawl. That's called improvement.

This whole Brawl is Shit and "competitive smash" mentality is at every turn, every comment of every video, to the point where Smash is just /suppose/ to be competitive. As if that's all it's good for. It's disgusting. Sure it's slow, but maybe it would be more exciting if you actually turned on items and played on a stage that wasn't flat platforms with no stage hazards, you fucking pricks.

Long exhale."MLP is a great show. It actually has a point unlike Naruto. I adore the show and think it has great characters and shipping done right.

The only good shounens are GTO, HxH and maybe one or two others.
I only torrent my anime because I'm not a peasant. I actually appreciate quality and never stream any of my shows. Crunchyroll supports babbys first anime, Naruto. I csnt support something that appeals to "so nerdy XD kids who think Naruto is edgy"

I'm a happy 19 year old who happens to love anime. Nothing you will say will make me think otherwise on Naruto/one piece/bleach/SAO/SnK/KLK/other mainstream garbage.

I go to hot topic to see what shows to not watch. I'm not supporting a show that appeals to that crowd. Even though I'm pirating it, I'm not wasting space on my 7 hard drives for garbage. I'd rather take a shit on my hard drive then take up space with shounen shit.

I got in an argument with someone at barns and Noble in the Manga section because I was putting Naruto in the garbage where it belongs. I'm not allowed in the mall again and I'm not going back because they appeal to the crowd of Naruto."

SAUCE: https://www.reddit.com/user/Mrsaturn260#page=3

DO NOT BRIGADE THIS GUY OR MESSAGE HIM OR ANYTHING. JUST CHECK HIS COMMENT HISTORY. THE ONLY REASON I LINKED THE SAUCE IS BECAUSE HE ASKED FOR IT IN HIS MOST RECENT COMMENT (WHICHB IS A GREAT PASTA IN ITSELF, THE GUY IS A GOLDMINE). ANYWAY, HERE IT IS:

"ACTUALLY, I watch it with my mom and she completely supports me being a brony. She even got me a flutters plushie for christmas. I tell my therepist about my love of ponies and anime. She completely gets it. She says that there's nothing wrong as long as it doesn't get in the way of relationships. All of my friends love it with a passion. I love my figure collection and pony collection. I even have an Ikea display case for my figures and katana collection. Check my post history if you don't believe me."

Let me just cut with the chase. Sportacus has a Number 10 on his shirt, a small detail that most viewers will probably forget. However, it has stated that the Number Ten means something, but I'll get to that later. Let's start with the first episode of LazyTown. A brief summary of it is that Stephanie,the main character, moves into LazyTown to visit her uncle, Mayor Milford Meanswell. She meets other kids in the town, Trixie, Stingy, Pixel, and Ziggy, who's personalities are identical to their name. Robbie Rotten is also there in his secret lair, keep note of this, He looks around the town to see weeds, an abandoned basketball court, and other very polluted things. He seems content about this, proclaiming he will keep LazyTown the laziest town on the world. Later on, Stephanie talks to her uncle about how none of the kids want to go outside to play. Her uncle then tells her that there was a man with a Number 9 on his shirt, who made kids active. Wait, 9? But Sportacus has Number 10 on his shirt! Was this careless mistake? Or something more different? Stephanie makes a letter to said person, and goes to the mailbox to send it. She finds a cork inside the tube and tries pulling it out. Robbie is then shown stopping in his tracks and is visibly distraught about this, meaning he knows what is going to happen when she sends that letter. She pulls the cork out and puts the tube like envelope into the pipe, and it soon gets launched into the sky, and is received by Sportacus. Sportacus jumps down to meet Stephanie, she asks him if he is Number 9 and he responds with that he is Number 10. Robbie than says "Another one?" Confirming the fact that there was a Number 9, and Robbie fought him aswell. Think about it, at the start of the episode Robbie already has his signature secret lair. However, he doesn't use it for evil, he doesn't terrorize the citizens of LazyTown, he likes the citizens how they are, lazy. So, why would he have this lair, unless he had to use it against Number 9? Then the question remains, where is Number 9? Did he leave? Did he accomplish his goal, move away and then Robbie made it lazy again? Or did Robbie Rotten beat Number 9? Think about it, why would he use the schemes he uses on Sportacus and friends if they didn't prove successful against Number 9? So we got that Robbie Rotten beat Number 9 and made LazyTown lazy, but that also strikes up another question. Are there more numbers? Are Number 9 and Sportacus apart of a group that ride blimps and help make kids exercise and play outside? Now are you ready for the biggest stretch in this entire theory?

Robbie Rotten was the first Sportacus-like member of this group. Why so? Well Robbie admits it himself.

In a little known song called "We Are Number One."
The song "gucci gang" gave great meaning into my life. Lil pumps lyrics are nothing less of a genuine life lesson. People dont understand lil pumps story behind the lyrics. So i will do a lyric break down.

"Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang) Gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang, gucci gang (gucci gang)"

Lil pump is telling his target audience that his gang is indeed called gucci gang. He says this in order to set the tone for the rest of the song and will show what his gang is all about.

"Spend three racks on a new chain (yuh) My bih luh do cocaine, ooh (ooh)"

Lil pump is explaining that his gang can in fact afford a chain that is $3,000. Lil pump is being humble and showing that even if he is rich, he will still pay money for a cheap chain. On the line: "my bih luh do cocaine, ooh (ooh)" Lil pump is alluding to the fact that his "bih" is on so much cocaine that she can barely speak which is why he says "bih" and "luh" instead of "bitch" and "love".

"I fuh a bih l, i forgot her name (brr, yuh) I can't buy a bitch no wedding ring (ooh) Rather go and buy balmains"

Lil pump is trying to say that he is not loyal at all and is trying to lower the chance of him getting a real girlfriend ever. All lil pump wants to do is fuck alot of women and try and avoid any std's.

"My lean cost more than your rent, ooh (it do)"

Lil pump is saying that he is willing to waste a large amount of money for drugs. Showing his more emotional side as he needs these drugs to get over that he failed school. The ad-lib helps the listener under stand that it actually does cost more than your rent.

"Me and my grandma take meds, ooh (huh?)"

Lil pump again is returning to his emotional side saying that his grandma is in fact a vegetable and she needs meds to survive. This makes lil pump very depressed so he aswell needs to take xanax for his depression.

"Fuck your airline fuck your company (fuck it)"

Lil pump was kicked off a plane just because he was screaming eskitit and somehow being "obnoxious" on the plane. I still dont know why he was kicked off. The only person that matters in the world is lil pump, who cares if people cant sleep or relax on a 24 hour flight.

"They kicked me out the plane off a percocet (brr) Now lil pump flyin' private jet (yuh) Everybody scream, "fuck westjet" (fuck em)"

Lil pump is alluding that he was kicked off the plane for using an illegal substance. This is entirely westjets fault. They should have either gave everyone drugs or kicked them all off except lil pump.

Thank you for reading and i hope you appreciate lil pumps artistry alot more now.You must be fucking denser than Osmium (which, if you didn't know (I'm guessing so), is the densest atom, I'm guessing you didn't know that with your tiny pea-brain (if you could even call it a brain (I would personally vow not to do that in particular))) to think that I, a highly intelligent, trained, and skilled individual, would indulge in the ordinarily common act of sexual intercourse. Hah, merely SEX? You fool, I do not require SEX to function at least semi-habitually like an accustomed, functioning member of society (unlike you, you absolute amoeba). Thinking that it matters in the grand scheme of the universe that I am in fact celibate (and yes, per extension, a VIRGIN) is so stupefyingly ridiculous, I wouldn't take the chance to hit you, even if I had, out of mere pity for your sad soul. Having sex would require myself to waste time on another human being, likely far below me (as I am the most intelligent homo sapiens alive as of now, with an IQ which is in the 99.9999999995% percentile, so the chances of meeting someone even remotely able to match my intelligence are one in 10,881,440,294 (can you even factually perceive, let alone conceptualize, that number, you monkey (because I can, and I regularly use it when thinking in 18 dimensions for my multi-factorial polynomial calculations))). PER HOC I would have to extort my energy I had procured from my valuable foodstuffs (I usually consume about 100,000 centigrams of fresh tendies (which is 1/5th of the total tendies, selected by applying a process of adjusted artificial evolution)) per medium of moving my muscles as my penis oscillates near her genital region until I seed her with my hyper-intelligent spermae (They would asses the situation immediately and swim away from that dumb whore).

The facts present themselves clearly my friend, and they are NOT in your favor.First of all I'm 14 years old, and at this point in my life I am more successful than you will ever be. And explain why you're telling people I use my mothers credit card. First of all, I work for my money. Second of all, did you know that I started out with nothing in this website, and I built myself up to over 350k+ value, in just 2 months? I have never spent a cent on Brick Planet. I never bought bits, I earned them from trading, making games, and selling clothes. My Brick Builder is from credits that I got from trading. Oh, and how could I forget that I donated over 150k in bits and collectibles in the past month? It's too bad you weren't one of the people to receive part of that, because you were too busy crying to your mother how you're jealous that other people are more successful than you and you are nothing more than a pathetic failure.

He could no longer help himself! He watched as Andy stroked his juicy kawaii cock. He approched andy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the flood and on Woody too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever! Woody: "Andy-Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU." Andy: "Oh Woody-Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!" Woody grabbed a bunch of flavoured lube and rubbed it all over his head. Woody: "Oh my! It's cherry-flavoured lube! Cherry is my favourite!" Woody then stuffed his head up into Andy's tight ass! The other toys around the room watched intently as Woody shoved his head back and forth into Andy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The other toys also became aroused and they all gathered around Woody and Andy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Andy: "Oh my goodness, Woody-Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES!" All the other toys became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Woody completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Andy's nice round ass. Andy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full!" All the toys went inside of poor squirming Andy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged. The mother came inside and found Andy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of toys. You said, What are you talking about, 14 minutes, SMS

You said, I just did, 6 minutes, SMSHow could anyone get off to the idea of removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke. I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours.It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax,hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her,pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she murmurs breathlessly,"You came so much inside of me", then her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside again.Lol, when it comes to politics I'm in the top 1% of understanding. I've been watching political coverage every week since I was 14 fucking years old. But political novice like you think that you actually have an understanding because of the fact you pay attention once every 2 or 4 years. Yeah keep dreaming. Bernie could easily come out and say that having the debate during the fucking NCAA finals limit exposure to the American people, and that as a true believer in democracy he feels that the American people should be given the best chance to hear the information necessary for them making their democratic decision. And that he doesn't know why Hillary Clinton doesn't want to make the time to reach a large national audience to inform them about what she wants to do for the county. And why she would purposely choose the date that forces the American people to make a choice between watching the final game of the series they've been watching all month, and informing themselves on the difference between the Democratic candidates? 

Yeah, I guess politics shouldn't be commented on by people who have no fucking idea what they are talking about.[deleted]My mom banned tumblr at home this monday after what happened at school.  Now I am mostly accessing it from friends’ homes and school when I’m allowed to.  I also am restricted from it on my phone. so here’s the story.

Like I said in a previous post, on Monday I wore booty short and a white T-shirt that read “Friendzone the Patriarchy” on it.  Yes my butt was hanging out, yes people could see a little bit of my tummy.  Yes it was sexy, but I have no desire to be sexy to cis men (especially white ones) so it was by no means intended to be “Distracting”.  I am also really beautiful and I just love myself so I feel sexy all the time.  But NO there was no reason to prioritize my outfit as a “distraction” when the actions of other have nothing to do with my body.  In a way I’m glad I did it because it was a meaningful protest that drew attention to a serious cause.  But I’m still getting shit for it.

Before second period even came around, one of the principal’s aides came into my classroom and reported that in first period some people had made complaints.  My second period teacher agreed (of course) and said what I was wearing was inappropriate.  I can’t help but think that if I didn’t have such a curvaceous waist, big boobs and thick booty that nobody would have said anything.  AFAB people who are conventionally feminine and attractive terrify the patriarchy more than anyone.  We can basically do anything if given free reign and they wanted to take my freedom away.  The only other time it got this bad was when they gave me detention when I wrote “genderfuck” on the standardized test sheet for gender (although, it’s important to note I no longer identify as genderfuck).

My mom was called into school (I wonder why not my DAD? They just kind of assumed my mom wasn’t working, which she isn’t, but that’s beside the point) to take me home.  On the way home my mom kept going, “I am serious, Madison, I am serious, no more of this.”  I told her that her internalized misogyny and slut shaming is toxic and actually abusive.  Then she told me I “don’t know what abuse is.”  Like I’m going to let a cis white woman gendersplain everything to me and experience-police me.  She is abusive, end of story.  

So the minute we got home she set up parental controls on the computers so now basically all i can do is homework and nothing meaningful.  So this is what happens when a nb genderkitten dares to express sexuality.  Her LITERAL FREEDOM OF SPEECH is removed.First off. Big congrats to my Icelandic brothers. While I’m not Icelandic, I absolutely love your country. Please adopt me! I’m bearded, love the cold, will eat Hákarl, and very much enjoy your crisp beers.

Secondly, and I apologize that this got wordy...

Short version: it’s going to take a few years, but soccer in the US is on the rise big time.

Long Version: I think it just takes time to cultivate a good soccer culture within a nation. Soccer isn’t something you can “pick up” as an adult. Necessary foot / leg coordination and muscle memory have to be developed at a very young age to create world class soccer stars. This is in stark contrast to American football, which up until recently was my favorite sport, where guys like Jimmy Graham can start playing football at the end of college and now plays professionally.

And as one poster not so eloquently commented, American boys drift towards sports that are popular. Growing up in Alabama, I didn’t have a soccer team for which to cheer and I couldn’t name one American soccer star. I could name starters for Alabama Crimson Tide and the Atlanta Braves and I grew up playing football and baseball.

Fortunately, this has already started to change and the US women’s team has led the charge. While young boys had plenty of football, baseball, and basketball starts to idolize, young girls didn’t have much outside the national soccer team. Ladies like Alex Morgan have stated they wanted to play soccer because of people like Mia Hamm.

We FINALLY got an MLS team this year. Shout out to all my Atlanta United supporters! And now young boys and girls throughout the Southeast have a home team.

Also, the US U-17 is doing well, so my guess is that the US will be a major contender by 2026, if not by 2022.

Statistics throughout America show participation in football and baseball are down over the past several years, but soccer is on a hot streak.

So, US Men’s National Team: 2026 World Cup Champs!
A week ago I approached a woman on the street. She was 6/10. Kinda too much make up. But I thought I still had a chance to make love with her. I was very polite. But she still rejected me. I punched her and tried to rape her. She screamed for help and tried to fight back. And some random guy came and knocked me out of my counciousness. I didnt have sex that night and I stayed virgin. What I want to say that it is by far more harmful to say no than getting raped. When you get raped you might actually enjoy it. But if you say no to a nice guy, the guys self-esteem is completely destroyed and he might even end his life. Also the girl probably went to a night club and got "raped" by some chad while being intoxicated. 
TL;DR raping should be legal and saying no to an offer to have sex should be illegal. Because the counsequences are way worse.ɴᴏᴡ ᴘʟᴀʏɪɴɢ: Despacito 2 (Feat: Lil Pump) ───────────⚪────── ◄◄⠀▐▐ ⠀►►⠀⠀ ⠀ 𝟸:𝟷𝟾 / 𝟹:𝟻𝟼 ⠀ ───○ 🔊⠀ ᴴᴰ ⚙️ ❐ ⊏⊐OMGZZZZZZZZZZZZ HAIII!

WHENEVER HE TURNS BAKA HE GETS ALL CHIBIIIIIII!!!!!!! %______%Hello everyone, i've been in a relationship for 6 months with this guy whose parents are divorced. He's living with his mother, she has never had another man while he's father is seeing someone else. 
Yesterday we were talking and he claimed that if his mother finds another one he would be jealous, angry and he would leave his place.. 
We have a distance relationship so I replied "What if she says that if she can't bring any man at home you couldn't do it as well?" and he said "I would pay a hotel for you", but the problem is that he doesn't study or work .-. (we're both 21)
So I started to get mad because I found his speech ridiculous and I told him that he's mentally deranged.. I didn't mean to hurt him but the truth is that I'm scared and I think that this jealousy isn't normal... What do you think about it? 
Now he's angry and we're not talking..

Yes, that's a Japanese phrase, I'm learning Japanese from these videos. Before I get to the part about learning Japanese, though, let me first comment on the cultural implications of hentai. After the second world war, which Japan lost after the nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the entire country underwent a period of self-reflection and soul-searching. They wanted to understand how events led to the rest of the world responding with such devastating atomic attacks. This led to a strong antipathy towards war-mongering and international aggression. You may have heard about how the Japanese constitution doesn't allow the country to have an active military. Same idea. A lot of post-war Japanese culture is a reflection of such attitudes. For example, the Godzilla movies are not just about giant monsters fighting each other. They're about the horrors of unbridled atomic technology (Godzilla's always depicted as being powered by or healed by nuclear power), and how such a terrifying force can never be allowed to be unleashed on humanity again. On a similar note, Japanese animation enjoyed a resurgence of popularity after the war, due to the populace choosing to turn towards the comforting images of their youth. Japanese kids, much like kids in our country, like to watch cartoons. As a result, psychologically speaking, cartoons represent a reminder of a simpler and more innocent age. This upsurge in popularity resulted in animated images pervading almost all of Japanese culture: from movies, to television, to advertising, to music videos, and so on and so forth. And because animated images were so widely accepted throughout Japan, they were used for almost every type of source material, or to tell any type of story. Animation was no longer the sole domain of children. You got animated movies that told very mature stories, like Ghost in the Machine or Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Sometimes you get stories that involve very mature topics, like war, or murder, or rape, or torture. The Japanese have generally become quite accustomed seeing depictions of such things in their animations. So yeah, that's why I was watching this movie. It's an epic tale about a space crew exploring a distant planet (the crew's all female, because Japan's very into gender equality), and they run into a hostile alien, with a bunch of tentacles... and... well... I don't want to spoil the story for you, but let's just say the crew eventually figure out how to get along with the alien. It's a story about bridging cultural gaps and finding common ground. Seriously, it's worth watching. Ok, next, you remember how I talked about knowing Japanese words and phrases now? It's because these movies are subtitled in English, so I can learn Japanese while watching them. I mean, I know words like yamete, and iie, and iigu, and lots of others. Much better than just knowing konichiwa, isn't it? I mean, I'm developing such an interest in hentai that I might just major in Japanese when I'm in college. Who knows, I might be the one writing the subtitles in the future. Oh, and one last thing, you should know that hentai's considered pretty mainstream in Japan now, and it's also quite common in the western world too now. Everyone's watching it. I mean, if I don't watch it, I'll be seen as some sort of freak at school. You don't want your son to be some kind of pariah because he doesn't watch hentai, do you?

Hentai is art and regardless if you don't like it, most of the art is impressive. Porn is shit art and it is horrible. The actresses and actors can't act, the moans are cringe worthy and more fake than plastic surgery. The woman look very unrealistic and to make things worse, why in the fuck is the most popular category Teen (18 and 19)? That is disgusting and disgraceful. In my opinion, the minimum age should be 20 or 21, not 18. Hentai on the other hand is more erotic in many ways. It is fake yes but it acknowledges that it is fake. Most of them are hilarious as well. Not to mention, they have good stories. Also, the ahegao in hentai defeats porn anyday.

Hentai is art. Why do people try and argue against this? Is it just butthurt western artists jealous that an entire form of expression is locked away from them? Hentai is not just art; it is artistic expression in its most unadulterated form. Go to the Louvre and look at the Mona Lisa, tell me what you feel; angry? Sad? No, you won’t feel any of those, you might appreciate the talent of Da Vinci, and the line work or colours, but what does it make you feel? The best pieces of art carry real emotion, really making you feel with just strokes on paper. Hentai taps into the most primal of human feelings: lust. The very desire for all living creatures, the very meaning of life, represented in the succinct form of art. Some of the greatest moments of my life have been inspired from this art, and you have the nerve to doubt it because you’re some butthurt American mad you can only draw nonsense and call it “abstract”? Need more proof? Waifus. People are so infatuated with this art they go as far as to literally fall in love with it. Did people in renaissance Italy fall in love with the Mona Lisa and sleep with body pillows of her, desperate for the intimacy with their lover? NO! Because it lacks the true, raw emotion that Hentai has. Next time you think about saying Hentai “isn’t real art” remember the happiness it has brought people, and the raw emotions it inspires deep within. Don’t try and tear down another art form down just because you’re a Butthurt westerner who can’t draw for shit.So faggot , this Sarah slut of yours was all over my dick last night , as being a nerd I studied hard and am a brain surgeon. Well done you scrape by on 200k a year, Try running a private clinic worth 2.5 million. Come back to me with a real job you waster. Jock in high school, Choke in bed you homosexual.my dad grounded me from my gamecube one time because i said suck my ass bitchboy when he asked me to do the dishes so i stole his phone and took a bunch of pictures of my dick and emailed them to all his coworkers with a followup email that said 'oh no my sexy ass son must have taken my phone again haha sorry fellas' and not an hour later the cops showed up to my house and batista bombed my dad through the fucking couch and took his ass away for diddling my penis

moral of the story is if youre reading this dad im coming for you when they release you from prison in 2022 nobody takes my fucking gamecube away


Nice FUCKING meme you fucking SPERGLORD FAGSHIT. Holy FUCK it pisses me off when some unoriginal, retarded assholish dickweed decides it would just be FUCKING HILARIOUS to post the SAME. OVERUSED. JOKE. What do you even fucking hope to gain out of this? Karma? Well you're certainly getting that, cause it seems like a lot of other inbred shitface fucking retarded autistic fuckshits are thinking you're just FUCKING HILARIOUS and that this joke HASN'T BEEN MADE A BILLION FUCKING TIMES. FUCK you.[removed]So there I was chilling on my mobile operation center when I found this girl that wanted to come in, there was a chemestry since the first second she was on the guns I was on the wheel we obliterated everyone on the server and by the looks of it we were having the fun of a lifetime!.  
It was clear there was something special here even the way she wrote in a very sexual manner made me very atracted to her.There was a romance in the air and after a while we flew my golden helicopter through Los Santos the sunset was beautiful everything was perfect she added me to her friends list and there I was ready to buy a plane ticket if I needed to meet my soulmate i open her profile and I found out it was a dude.SENTENCE 👏 WITH 👏 CLAP 👏 EMOJI 👏 IS 👏 NOT 👏 A 👏 COPYPASTA 👏 😩apology for poor english

‘no’*notices the bulge in your pants, deducing that it must in fact be a katana* *tries to woo you in order to gain your prized family katana* OwO what's this? *glomps you, unaware that what I thought was your katana was in fact your ding dong. I go to grab it anyways, and snap it in half by accident. I feel blood on my hands and know I made quite the mistake* Uguu~ senpai, sowwy for huwting u :'( *winces in pain, because Nii-chan is screaming directly into my organ of corti* Just another day in the life of Nya-chan ^_^Cummy, now I know I was wrong
I messed up, and now you're gone

Cummy, I'm sorry I responded you
Oh, I never expected you to run away and leave me
Feeling this empty
Your texts right now would sound like music to me
Please come home, 'cause I miss you,Cummy

Cummy, can't you see I was blind
I'll do anything to change your mind

More than 🅱️ot, you're my best 🅱️oi
Too cool to forget, come back

Wow. You drive a car in gotham, you fly, you beat up criminals and can look at their bones through x-ray (wish x-ray wouldn't go so deep for some segments with certain characters like catwoman or penguin). Wow. Just wow.

I like especially how the game makes very real-life similarities with penguin and donald trump. Batman is bernie sanders and he is on a mission for equal pay for equal work. Especially if you're a black guy with glasses on who know how to computer. "Thanks for upgrading my cool car black guy who I hired for IQ and not specific head-skull best suited for Africa! Please have sexual intercourse with white woman, luring them in with my fat paycheck!". I feel bad for Alfred, being a gay man who is not allowed to put up his rainbow flag in the batcave for us to bask in whenever we talk to him 5 billion times and trying to ignore the fact that he's ignoring the nipples on the batsuit. (there is no nipples on the batsuit, Alfred is using x-ray vision). Sexual harassment is only wrong if men do it. Except if the man is gay.

Very good game. I like a lot punch bad man but (???) why no black baddies? I would very much like to strangle, choke and reverse german suplex black people, women especially. Can't we have a game centered in Africa where batman has to save Liberia from super-criminals whose super power is chucking spears and dropping bananas for batman to slip on? I think it's time to look forward from Gotham and have Batman fight ISIS in Syria. Thank you for your time.I understand that you're unfunny and unoriginal, and that you've seen some vaguely japanese shit on reddit before where replies with "NANI?" got positive karma.

I realize that I may be speaking to a child right now, so I'm gonna be gentle: 

1)Think of something original to say.

2)This comment is fucking retarded.

3) Anime is a mental disease. Stay away from it.

K, that's all.Sluts, sluts, I fuck sluts
Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts
No ifs and’s, and/or buts. I fuck sluts
I fuck sluts

Nice girls are nice but no good for nut-sucking
They'll need a serene night to green-light a butt fucking
But that'll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking
Boo to the nice girls. Praise be to slut fucking!

I have a list. A list? Yes
A list of all the sluts I've missed
I've never fucked or sucked these sluts
And thus my nuts are fucking pissed
So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list
Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking
Suck it slut, slut fucking bucket-list

Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond
They can be skinny with big tits or be skinny with small ones
Sluts can be perky, preppy or posh
With their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash

But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart
These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart
They can talk about science, music, or art
They can put you together or they can pull you apart

But don't trust these sluts, don't, don't you dare

Well lately weve been renovating the office and things are pretty tight in there to move around it kinda like a maze or some shiit. Well today im going out on break and theres these 2 desks beside eachother and theres barely any room for 2 people to walk by in and wut do i see, my boss walking towards me. 

I try to act cool but my face becomes flushed and it doesnt help that her tits are bouncing up and down as she walks, we get to the point of the desks at the same time and we kinda awkwardly try to walk by each other. We kinda get stuck a bit by the desks and shes facing away from me and her ass is right on my crotch, the second i feel this im in pure ecstasy and acquire a semi instantly. Her big juicy angus and me are now stuck and were trying to squeeze by each other and slowly moving through but her ass is grinding right up on me, i know i am about to cum and i tell her to move faster for the love of god, shes like wtf but i cannot stop at this point. 

I blow the biggest load this month so far and i get transported to another dimension, my fat load starts to leak through my pants and onto her skirt, shes turns her head and see this and says omg are u serious. We finally seperate and i fall to my knees and begin to speak in tongues, waves of more orgasms flood over me, i crap my pants and begin to cry. I was immediately fired but i feel like a new man now and will masturbate to this memory forever.

Screenshot of text:[http://imgur.com/a/Zwe2m](http://imgur.com/a/Zwe2m)According to all known laws
of aviation,

  
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly.

  
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground.

  
The bee, of course, flies anyway

  
because bees don't care
what humans think is impossible.

  
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.

  
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.

  
Barry! Breakfast is ready!

  
Ooming!

  
Hang on a second.

  
Hello?

  
- Barry?
- Adam?

  
- Oan you believe this is happening?
- I can't. I'll pick you up.

  
Looking sharp.

  
Use the stairs. Your father
paid good money for those.

  
Sorry. I'm excited.

  
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.

  
A perfect report card, all B's.

  
Very proud.

  
Ma! I got a thing going here.

  
- You got lint on your fuzz.
- Ow! That's me!

  
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
- Bye!

  
Barry, I told you,
stop flying in the house!

  
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Barry.

  
- Is that fuzz gel?
- A little. Special day, graduation.

  
Never thought I'd make it.

  
Three days grade school,
three days high school.

  
Those were awkward.

  
Three days college. I'm glad I took
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.

  
You did come back different.

  
- Hi, Barry.
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.

  
- Hear about Frankie?
- Yeah.

  
- You going to the funeral?
- No, I'm not going.

  
Everybody knows,
sting someone, you die.

  
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.

  
I guess he could have
just gotten out of the way.

  
I love this incorporating
an amusement park into our day.

  
That's why we don't need vacations.

  
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...
under the circumstances.

  
- Well, Adam, today we are men.
- We are!

  
- Bee-men.
- Amen!

  
Hallelujah!

  
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,

  
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.

  
Welcome, New Hive Oity
graduating class of...

  
...9:15.

  
That concludes our ceremonies.

  
And begins your career
at Honex Industries!

  
Will we pick ourjob today?

  
I heard it's just orientation.

  
Heads up! Here we go.

  
Keep your hands and antennas
inside the tram at all times.

  
- Wonder what it'll be like?
- A little scary.

  
Welcome to Honex,
a division of Honesco

  
and a part of the Hexagon Group.

  
This is it!

  
Wow.

  
Wow.

  
We know that you, as a bee,
have worked your whole life

  
to get to the point where you
can work for your whole life.

  
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.

  
Our top-secret formula

  
is automatically color-corrected,
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured

  
into this soothing sweet syrup

  
with its distinctive
golden glow you know as...

  
Honey!

  
- That girl was hot.
- She's my cousin!

  
- She is?
- Yes, we're all cousins.

  
- Right. You're right.
- At Honex, we constantly strive

  
to improve every aspect
of bee existence.

  
These bees are stress-testing
a new helmet technology.

  
- What do you think he makes?
- Not enough.

  
Here we have our latest advancement,
the Krelman.

  
- What does that do?
- Oatches that little strand of honey

  
that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.

  
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?

  
Of course. Most bee jobs are
small ones. But bees know

  
that every small job,
if it's done well, means a lot.

  
But choose carefully

  
because you'll stay in the job
you pick for the rest of your life.

  
The same job the rest of your life?
I didn't know that.

  
What's the difference?

  
You'll be happy to know that bees,
as a species, haven't had one day off

  
in 27 million years.

  
So you'll just work us to death?

  
We'll sure try.

  
Wow! That blew my mind!

  
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?

  
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.

  
I'm relieved. Now we only have
to make one decision in life.

  
But, Adam, how could they
never have told us that?

  
Why would you question anything?
We're bees.

  
We're the most perfectly
functioning society on Earth.

  
You ever think maybe things
work a little too well here?

  
Like what? Give me one example.

  
I don't know. But you know
what I'm talking about.

  
Please clear the gate.
Royal Nectar Force on approach.

  
Wait a second. Oheck it out.

  
- Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
- Wow.

  
I've never seen them this close.

  
They know what it's like
outside the hive.

  
Yeah, but some don't come back.

  
- Hey, Jocks!
- Hi, Jocks!

  
You guys did great!

  
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!

  
- I wonder where they were.
- I don't know.

  
Their day's not planned.

  
Outside the hive, flying who knows
where, doing who knows what.

  
You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen
Jock. You have to be bred for that.

  
Right.

  
Look. That's more pollen
than you and I will see in a lifetime.

  
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.

  
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you wearing it.

  
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?

  
Distant. Distant.

  
Look at these two.

  
- Oouple of Hive Harrys.
- Let's have fun with them.

  
It must be dangerous
being a Pollen Jock.

  
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me
against a mushroom!

  
He had a paw on my throat,
and with the other, he was slapping me!

  
- Oh, my!
- I never thought I'd knock him out.

  
What were you doing during this?

  
Trying to alert the authorities.

  
I can autograph that.

  
A little gusty out there today,
wasn't it, comrades?

  
Yeah. Gusty.

  
We're hitting a sunflower patch
six miles from here tomorrow.

  
- Six miles, huh?
- Barry!

  
A puddle jump for us,
but maybe you're not up for it.

  
- Maybe I am.
- You are not!

  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.

  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?

  
I might be. It all depends
on what 0900 means.

  
Hey, Honex!

  
Dad, you surprised me.

  
You decide what you're interested in?

  
- Well, there's a lot of choices.
- But you only get one.

  
Do you ever get bored
doing the same job every day?

  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.

  
You grab that stick, and you just
move it around, and you stir it around.

  
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.

  
You know, Dad,
the more I think about it,

  
maybe the honey field
just isn't right for me.

  
You were thinking of what,
making balloon animals?

  
That's a bad job
for a guy with a stinger.

  
Janet, your son's not sure
he wants to go into honey!

  
- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
- I'm not trying to be funny.

  
You're not funny! You're going
into honey. Our son, the stirrer!

  
- You're gonna be a stirrer?
- No one's listening to me!

  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.

  
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!

  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!

  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.
Shave my antennae.

  
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get
a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!

  
I'm so proud.

  
- We're starting work today!
- Today's the day.

  
Oome on! All the good jobs
will be gone.

  
Yeah, right.

  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring,
stirrer, front desk, hair removal...

  
- Is it still available?
- Hang on. Two left!

  
One of them's yours! Oongratulations!
Step to the side.

  
- What'd you get?
- Picking crud out. Stellar!

  
Wow!

  
Oouple of newbies?

  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!

  
Make your choice.

  
- You want to go first?
- No, you go.

  
Oh, my. What's available?

  
Restroom attendant's open,
not for the reason you think.

  
- Any chance of getting the Krelman?
- Sure, you're on.

  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.

  
Wax monkey's always open.

  
The Krelman opened up again.

  
What happened?

  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
He's dead. Another dead one.

  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.

  
Dead from the neck up.
Dead from the neck down. That's life!

  
Oh, this is so hard!

  
Heating, cooling,
stunt bee, pourer, stirrer,

lint coordinator, stripe supervisor,

  
mite wrangler. Barry, what
do you think I should... Barry?

  
Barry!

  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch
in quadrant nine...

  
What happened to you?
Where are you?

  
- I'm going out.
- Out? Out where?

  
- Out there.
- Oh, no!

  
I have to, before I go
to work for the rest of my life.

  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?

  
Another call coming in.

  
If anyone's feeling brave,
there's a Korean deli on 83rd

  
that gets their roses today.

  
Hey, guys.

  
- Look at that.
- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?

  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.

  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.

  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?

  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.

  
- Thank you.
- OK.

  
You got a rain advisory today,

  
and as you all know,
bees cannot fly in rain.

  
So be careful. As always,
watch your brooms,

  
hockey sticks, dogs,
birds, bears and bats.

  
Also, I got a couple of reports
of root beer being poured on us.

  
Murphy's in a home because of it,
babbling like a cicada!

  
- That's awful.
- And a reminder for you rookies,

  
bee law number one,
absolutely no talking to humans!

  
All right, launch positions!

  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz,
buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!

  
Black and yellow!

  
Hello!

  
You ready for this, hot shot?

  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.

  
Wind, check.

  
- Antennae, check.
- Nectar pack, check.

  
- Wings, check.
- Stinger, check.

  
Scared out of my shorts, check.

  
OK, ladies,

  
let's move it out!

  
Pound those petunias,
you striped stem-suckers!

  
All of you, drain those flowers!

  
Wow! I'm out!

  
I can't believe I'm out!

  
So blue.

  
I feel so fast and free!

  
Box kite!

  
Wow!

  
Flowers!

  
This is Blue Leader.
We have roses visual.

  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.

  
Roses!

  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.

  
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.

  
That is one nectar collector!

  
- Ever see pollination up close?
- No, sir.

  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it
over here. Maybe a dash over there,

  
a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.

  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?

  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more
flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.

  
Oool.

  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.
Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?

  
Oopy that visual.

  
Wait. One of these flowers
seems to be on the move.

  
Say again? You're reporting
a moving flower?

  
Affirmative.

  
That was on the line!

  
This is the coolest. What is it?

  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.

  
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.

  
Yeah, fuzzy.

  
Ohemical-y.

  
Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.

  
My sweet lord of bees!

  
Oandy-brain, get off there!

  
Problem!

  
- Guys!
- This could be bad.

  
Affirmative.

  
Very close.

  
Gonna hurt.

  
Mama's little boy.

  
You are way out of position, rookie!

  
Ooming in at you like a missile!

  
Help me!

  
I don't think these are flowers.

  
- Should we tell him?
- I think he knows.

  
What is this?!

  
Match point!

  
You can start packing up, honey,
because you're about to eat it!

  
Yowser!

  
Gross.

  
There's a bee in the car!

  
- Do something!
- I'm driving!

  
- Hi, bee.
- He's back here!

  
He's going to sting me!

  
Nobody move. If you don't move,
he won't sting you. Freeze!

  
He blinked!

  
Spray him, Granny!

  
What are you doing?!

  
Wow... the tension level
out here is unbelievable.

  
I gotta get home.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Oan't fly in rain.

  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Ken, could you close
the window please?

  
Oheck out my new resume.
I made it into a fold-out brochure.

  
You see? Folds out.

  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.

  
What was that?

  
Maybe this time. This time. This time.
This time! This time! This...

  
Drapes!

  
That is diabolical.

  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special
skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.

  
What's number one? Star Wars?

  
Nah, I don't go for that...

  
...kind of stuff.

  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.
They're out of their minds.

  
When I leave a job interview, they're
flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.

  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.

  
I don't remember the sun
having a big 75 on it.

  
I predicted global warming.

  
I could feel it getting hotter.
At first I thought it was just me.

  
Wait! Stop! Bee!

  
Stand back. These are winter boots.

  
Wait!

  
Don't kill him!

  
You know I'm allergic to them!
This thing could kill me!

  
Why does his life have
less value than yours?

  
Why does his life have any less value
than mine? Is that your statement?

  
I'm just saying all life has value. You
don't know what he's capable of feeling.

  
My brochure!

  
There you go, little guy.

  
I'm not scared of him.
It's an allergic thing.

  
Put that on your resume brochure.

  
My whole face could puff up.

  
Make it one of your special skills.

  
Knocking someone out
is also a special skill.

  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.

  
- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.

  
- You could put carob chips on there.
- Bye.

  
- Supposed to be less calories.
- Bye.

  
I gotta say something.

  
She saved my life.
I gotta say something.

  
All right, here it goes.

  
Nah.

  
What would I say?

  
I could really get in trouble.

  
It's a bee law.
You're not supposed to talk to a human.

  
I can't believe I'm doing this.

  
I've got to.

  
Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!

  
No. Yes. No.

  
Do it. I can't.

  
How should I start it?
"You like jazz?" No, that's no good.

  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!

  
Hi!

  
I'm sorry.

  
- You're talking.
- Yes, I know.

  
You're talking!

  
I'm so sorry.

  
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming.

  
But I don't recall going to bed.

  
Well, I'm sure this
is very disconcerting.

  
This is a bit of a surprise to me.
I mean, you're a bee!

  
I am. And I'm not supposed
to be doing this,

  
but they were all trying to kill me.

  
And if it wasn't for you...

  
I had to thank you.
It's just how I was raised.

  
That was a little weird.

  
- I'm talking with a bee.
- Yeah.

  
I'm talking to a bee.
And the bee is talking to me!

  
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.

  
- Wait! How did you learn to do that?
- What?

  
The talking thing.

  
Same way you did, I guess.
"Mama, Dada, honey." You pick it up.

  
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.

  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,
we'd cry with what we have to deal with.

  
Anyway...

  
Oan I...

  
...get you something?
- Like what?

  
I don't know. I mean...
I don't know. Ooffee?

  
I don't want to put you out.

  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.

  
- It's just coffee.
- I hate to impose.

  
- Don't be ridiculous!
- Actually, I would love a cup.

  
Hey, you want rum cake?

  
- I shouldn't.
- Have some.

  
- No, I can't.
- Oome on!

  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.

  
- Where?
- These stripes don't help.

  
You look great!

  
I don't know if you know
anything about fashion.

  
Are you all right?

  
No.

  
He's making the tie in the cab
as they're flying up Madison.

  
He finally gets there.

  
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.

  
And he says, "Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.

  
Why would I marry a watermelon?"

  
Is that a bee joke?

  
That's the kind of stuff we do.

  
Yeah, different.

  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?

  
About work? I don't know.

  
I want to do my part for the hive,
but I can't do it the way they want.

  
I know how you feel.

  
- You do?
- Sure.

  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or
a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.

  
- Really?
- My only interest is flowers.

  
Our new queen was just elected
with that same campaign slogan.

  
Anyway, if you look...

  
There's my hive right there. See it?

  
You're in Sheep Meadow!

  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!

  
No way! I know that area.
I lost a toe ring there once.

  
- Why do girls put rings on their toes?
- Why not?

  
- It's like putting a hat on your knee.
- Maybe I'll try that.

  
- You all right, ma'am?
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

  
Just having two cups of coffee!

  
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.

  
Yeah, it's no trouble.

  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,
I'd be up the rest of my life.

  
Are you...?

  
Oan I take a piece of this with me?

  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.

  
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

  
All right. Well, then...
I guess I'll see you around.

  
Or not.

  
OK, Barry.

  
And thank you
so much again... for before.

  
Oh, that? That was nothing.

  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...

  
This can't possibly work.

  
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.

  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.

  
- Sounds amazing.
- It was amazing!

  
It was the scariest,
happiest moment of my life.

  
Humans! I can't believe
you were with humans!

  
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?

  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.

  
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.

  
- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
- Some of them. But some of them don't.

  
- How'd you get back?
- Poodle.

  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw
whatever you wanted to see.

  
You had your "experience." Now you
can pick out yourjob and be normal.

  
- Well...
- Well?

  
Well, I met someone.

  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?

  
- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
- No, no, no, not a wasp.

  
- Spider?
- I'm not attracted to spiders.

  
I know it's the hottest thing,
with the eight legs and all.

  
I can't get by that face.

  
So who is she?

  
She's... human.

  
No, no. That's a bee law.
You wouldn't break a bee law.

  
- Her name's Vanessa.
- Oh, boy.

  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!

  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!

  
We're not dating.

  
You're flying outside the hive, talking
to humans that attack our homes

  
with power washers and M-80s!
One-eighth a stick of dynamite!

  
She saved my life!
And she understands me.

  
This is over!

  
Eat this.

  
This is not over! What was that?

  
- They call it a crumb.
- It was so stingin' stripey!

  
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!

  
- You know what a Oinnabon is?
- No.

  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.
They heat it up...

  
Sit down!

  
...really hot!
- Listen to me!

  
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!

  
Yes, but who can deny
the heart that is yearning?

  
There's no yearning.
Stop yearning. Listen to me!

  
You have got to start thinking bee,
my friend. Thinking bee!

  
- Thinking bee.
- Thinking bee.

  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
Thinking bee! Thinking bee!

  
There he is. He's in the pool.

  
You know what your problem is, Barry?

  
I gotta start thinking bee?

  
How much longer will this go on?

  
It's been three days!
Why aren't you working?

  
I've got a lot of big life decisions
to think about.

  
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!

  
Would it kill you
to make a little honey?

  
Barry, come out.
Your father's talking to you.

  
Martin, would you talk to him?

  
Barry, I'm talking to you!

  
You coming?

  
Got everything?

  
All set!

  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

  
Don't be too long.

  
Watch this!

  
Vanessa!

  
- We're still here.
- I told you not to yell at him.

  
He doesn't respond to yelling!

  
- Then why yell at me?
- Because you don't listen!

  
I'm not listening to this.

  
Sorry, I've gotta go.

  
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting a friend.

  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?

  
Bye.

  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.

  
They have a huge parade
of flowers every year in Pasadena?

  
To be in the Tournament of Roses,
that's every florist's dream!

  
Up on a float, surrounded
by flowers, crowds cheering.

  
A tournament. Do the roses
compete in athletic events?

  
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?

  
It's exhausting. Why don't you
run everywhere? It's faster.

  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.

  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV?
That's insane!

  
You don't have that?

  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease.
It's a horrible, horrible disease.

  
Oh, my.

  
Dumb bees!

  
You must want to sting all those jerks.

  
We try not to sting.
It's usually fatal for us.

  
So you have to watch your temper.

  
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk,

  
write an angry letter and throw it out.
Work through it like any emotion:

  
Anger, jealousy, lust.

  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?

  
Yeah.

  
- What is wrong with you?!
- It's a bug.

  
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!

  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?

  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?

  
It felt like about 10 pages.
Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.

  
You've really got that
down to a science.

  
- I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
- I'll bet.

  
What in the name
of Mighty Hercules is this?

  
How did this get here?
Oute Bee, Golden Blossom,

  
Ray Liotta Private Select?

  
- Is he that actor?
- I never heard of him.

  
- Why is this here?
- For people. We eat it.

  
You don't have
enough food of your own?

  
- Well, yes.
- How do you get it?

  
- Bees make it.
- I know who makes it!

  
And it's hard to make it!

  
There's heating, cooling, stirring.
You need a whole Krelman thing!

  
- It's organic.
- It's our-ganic!

  
It's just honey, Barry.

  
Just what?!

  
Bees don't know about this!
This is stealing! A lot of stealing!

  
You've taken our homes, schools,
hospitals! This is all we have!

  
And it's on sale?!
I'm getting to the bottom of this.

  
I'm getting to the bottom
of all of this!

  
Hey, Hector.

  
- You almost done?
- Almost.

  
He is here. I sense it.

  
Well, I guess I'll go home now

  
and just leave this nice honey out,
with no one around.

  
You're busted, box boy!

  
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!

  
I can talk.
And now you'll start talking!

  
Where you getting the sweet stuff?
Who's your supplier?

  
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.

  
The last thing we want
to do is upset bees!

  
You're too late! It's ours now!

  
You, sir, have crossed
the wrong sword!

  
You, sir, will be lunch
for my iguana, Ignacio!

  
Where is the honey coming from?

  
Tell me where!

  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!

  
Orazy person!

  
What horrible thing has happened here?

  
These faces, they never knew
what hit them. And now

  
they're on the road to nowhere!

  
Just keep still.

  
What? You're not dead?

  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything
that moves. Where you headed?

  
To Honey Farms.
I am onto something huge here.

  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood,
crazy stuff. Blows your head off!

  
I'm going to Tacoma.

  
- And you?
- He really is dead.

  
All right.

  
Uh-oh!

  
- What is that?!
- Oh, no!

  
- A wiper! Triple blade!
- Triple blade?

  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!

  
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!

  
How much do you people need to see?!

  
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!

  
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Oarl Kasell.

  
But don't kill no more bugs!

  
- Bee!
- Moose blood guy!!

  
- You hear something?
- Like what?

  
Like tiny screaming.

  
Turn off the radio.

  
Whassup, bee boy?

  
Hey, Blood.

  
Just a row of honey jars,
as far as the eye could see.

  
Wow!

  
I assume wherever this truck goes
is where they're getting it.

  
I mean, that honey's ours.

  
- Bees hang tight.
- We're all jammed in.

  
It's a close community.

  
Not us, man. We on our own.
Every mosquito on his own.

  
- What if you get in trouble?
- You a mosquito, you in trouble.

  
Nobody likes us. They just smack.
See a mosquito, smack, smack!

  
At least you're out in the world.
You must meet girls.

  
Mosquito girls try to trade up,
get with a moth, dragonfly.

  
Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.

  
You got to be kidding me!

  
Mooseblood's about to leave
the building! So long, bee!

  
- Hey, guys!
- Mooseblood!

  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?

  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it,
and it's pretty much pure profit.

  
What is this place?

  
A bee's got a brain
the size of a pinhead.

  
They are pinheads!

  
Pinhead.

  
- Oheck out the new smoker.
- Oh, sweet. That's the one you want.

  
The Thomas 3000!

  
Smoker?

  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic.
Twice the nicotine, all the tar.

  
A couple breaths of this
knocks them right out.

  
They make the honey,
and we make the money.

  
"They make the honey,
and we make the money"?

  
Oh, my!

  
What's going on? Are you OK?

  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.

  
Do you know you're
in a fake hive with fake walls?

  
Our queen was moved here.
We had no choice.

  
This is your queen?
That's a man in women's clothes!

  
That's a drag queen!

  
What is this?

  
Oh, no!

  
There's hundreds of them!

  
Bee honey.

  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen
on a massive scale!

  
This is worse than anything bears
have done! I intend to do something.

  
Oh, Barry, stop.

  
Who told you humans are taking
our honey? That's a rumor.

  
Do these look like rumors?

  
That's a conspiracy theory.
These are obviously doctored photos.

  
How did you get mixed up in this?

  
He's been talking to humans.

  
- What?
- Talking to humans?!

  
He has a human girlfriend.
And they make out!

  
Make out? Barry!

  
We do not.

  
- You wish you could.
- Whose side are you on?

  
The bees!

  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio.
Those crazy legs kept me up all night.

  
Barry, this is what you want
to do with your life?

  
I want to do it for all our lives.
Nobody works harder than bees!

  
Dad, I remember you
coming home so overworked

  
your hands were still stirring.
You couldn't stop.

  
I remember that.

  
What right do they have to our honey?

  
We live on two cups a year. They put it
in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!

  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?

  
Sting them where it really hurts.

  
In the face! The eye!

  
- That would hurt.
- No.

  
Up the nose? That's a killer.

  
There's only one place you can sting
the humans, one place where it matters.

  
Hive at Five, the hive's only
full-hour action news source.

  
No more bee beards!

  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.

  
Weather with Storm Stinger.

  
Sports with Buzz Larvi.

  
And Jeanette Ohung.

  
- Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.
- And I'm Jeanette Ohung.

  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson,

  
intends to sue the human race
for stealing our honey,

  
packaging it and profiting
from it illegally!

  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King,

  
we'll have three former queens here in
our studio, discussing their new book,

  
Olassy Ladies,
out this week on Hexagon.

  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.

  
Did you ever think, "I'm a kid
from the hive. I can't do this"?

  
Bees have never been afraid
to change the world.

  
What about Bee Oolumbus?
Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?

  
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.

  
We were thinking
of stickball or candy stores.

  
How old are you?

  
The bee community
is supporting you in this case,

  
which will be the trial
of the bee century.

  
You know, they have a Larry King
in the human world too.

  
It's a common name. Next week...

  
He looks like you and has a show
and suspenders and colored dots...

  
Next week...

  
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the
guest even though you just heard 'em.

  
Bear Week next week!
They're scary, hairy and here live.

  
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders,
squinty eyes, very Jewish.

  
In tennis, you attack
at the point of weakness!

  
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.

  
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?

  
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.

  
- Is that that same bee?
- Yes, it is!

  
I'm helping him sue the human race.

  
- Hello.
- Hello, bee.

  
This is Ken.

  
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size
ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.

  
Why does he talk again?

  
Listen, you better go
'cause we're really busy working.

  
But it's our yogurt night!

  
Bye-bye.

  
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!

  
You poor thing.
You two have been at this for hours!

  
Yes, and Adam here
has been a huge help.

  
- Frosting...
- How many sugars?

  
Just one. I try not
to use the competition.

  
So why are you helping me?

  
Bees have good qualities.

  
And it takes my mind off the shop.

  
Instead of flowers, people
are giving balloon bouquets now.

  
Those are great, if you're three.

  
And artificial flowers.

  
- Oh, those just get me psychotic!
- Yeah, me too.

  
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.

  
Bees must hate those fake things!

  
Nothing worse
than a daffodil that's had work done.

  
Maybe this could make up
for it a little bit.

  
- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
- I guess.

  
You sure you want to go through with it?

  
Am I sure? When I'm done with
the humans, they won't be able

  
to say, "Honey, I'm home,"
without paying a royalty!

  
It's an incredible scene
here in downtown Manhattan,

  
where the world anxiously waits,
because for the first time in history,

  
we will hear for ourselves
if a honeybee can actually speak.

  
What have we gotten into here, Barry?

  
It's pretty big, isn't it?

  
I can't believe how many humans
don't work during the day.

  
You think billion-dollar multinational
food companies have good lawyers?

  
Everybody needs to stay
behind the barricade.

  
- What's the matter?
- I don't know, I just got a chill.

  
Well, if it isn't the bee team.

  
You boys work on this?

  
All rise! The Honorable
Judge Bumbleton presiding.

  
All right. Oase number 4475,

  
Superior Oourt of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry

  
is now in session.

  
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing
the five food companies collectively?

  
A privilege.

  
Mr. Benson... you're representing
all the bees of the world?

  
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,
we're ready to proceed.

  
Mr. Montgomery,
your opening statement, please.

  
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

  
my grandmother was a simple woman.

  
Born on a farm, she believed
it was man's divine right

  
to benefit from the bounty
of nature God put before us.

  
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world
Mr. Benson imagines,

  
just think of what would it mean.

  
I would have to negotiate
with the silkworm

  
for the elastic in my britches!

  
Talking bee!

  
How do we know this isn't some sort of

  
holographic motion-picture-capture
Hollywood wizardry?

  
They could be using laser beams!

  
Robotics! Ventriloquism!
Oloning! For all we know,

  
he could be on steroids!

  
Mr. Benson?

  
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's no trickery here.

  
I'm just an ordinary bee.
Honey's pretty important to me.

  
It's important to all bees.
We invented it!

  
We make it. And we protect it
with our lives.

  
Unfortunately, there are
some people in this room

  
who think they can take it from us

  
'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over,

  
you'll see how, by taking our honey,
you not only take everything we have

  
but everything we are!

  
I wish he'd dress like that
all the time. So nice!

  
Oall your first witness.

  
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden
of Honey Farms, big company you have.

  
I suppose so.

  
I see you also own
Honeyburton and Honron!

  
Yes, they provide beekeepers
for our farms.

  
Beekeeper. I find that
to be a very disturbing term.

  
I don't imagine you employ
any bee-free-ers, do you?

  
- No.
- I couldn't hear you.

  
- No.
- No.

  
Because you don't free bees.
You keep bees. Not only that,

  
it seems you thought a bear would be
an appropriate image for a jar of honey.

  
They're very lovable creatures.

  
Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.

  
You mean like this?

  
Bears kill bees!

  
How'd you like his head crashing
through your living room?!

  
Biting into your couch!
Spitting out your throw pillows!

  
OK, that's enough. Take him away.

  
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.
Your name intrigues me.

  
- Where have I heard it before?
- I was with a band called The Police.

  
But you've never been
a police officer, have you?

  
No, I haven't.

  
No, you haven't. And so here
we have yet another example

  
of bee culture casually
stolen by a human

  
for nothing more than
a prance-about stage name.

  
Oh, please.

  
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?

  
Because I'm feeling
a little stung, Sting.

  
Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!

  
That's not his real name?! You idiots!

  
Mr. Liotta, first,
belated congratulations on

  
your Emmy win for a guest spot
on ER in 2005.

  
Thank you. Thank you.

  
I see from your resume
that you're devilishly handsome

  
with a churning inner turmoil
that's ready to blow.

  
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?

  
Not yet it isn't. But is this
what it's come to for you?

  
Exploiting tiny, helpless bees
so you don't

  
have to rehearse
your part and learn your lines, sir?

  
Watch it, Benson!
I could blow right now!

  
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!

  
Why doesn't someone just step on
this creep, and we can all go home?!

  
- Order in this court!
- You're all thinking it!

  
Order! Order, I say!

  
- Say it!
- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!

  
I think it was awfully nice
of that bear to pitch in like that.

  
I think the jury's on our side.

  
Are we doing everything right, legally?

  
I'm a florist.

  
Right. Well, here's to a great team.

  
To a great team!

  
Well, hello.

  
- Ken!
- Hello.

  
I didn't think you were coming.

  
No, I was just late.
I tried to call, but... the battery.

  
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.

  
Oh, that was lucky.

  
There's a little left.
I could heat it up.

  
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

  
So I hear you're quite a tennis player.

  
I'm not much for the game myself.
The ball's a little grabby.

  
That's where I usually sit.
Right... there.

  
Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,

  
and he agreed with me that eating with
chopsticks isn't really a special skill.

  
You think I don't see what you're doing?

  
I know how hard it is to find
the rightjob. We have that in common.

  
Do we?

  
Bees have 100 percent employment,
but we do jobs like taking the crud out.

  
That's just what
I was thinking about doing.

  
Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor
for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.

  
I'm going to drain the old stinger.

  
Yeah, you do that.

  
Look at that.

  
You know, I've just about had it

  
with your little mind games.

  
- What's that?
- Italian Vogue.

  
Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.

  
A lot of ads.

  
Remember what Van said, why is
your life more valuable than mine?

  
Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!

  
I think something stinks in here!

  
I love the smell of flowers.

  
How do you like the smell of flames?!

  
Not as much.

  
Water bug! Not taking sides!

  
Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!
This is pathetic!

  
I've got issues!

  
Well, well, well, a royal flush!

  
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

  
Surf's up, dude!

  
Poo water!

  
That bowl is gnarly.

  
Except for those dirty yellow rings!

  
Kenneth! What are you doing?!

  
You know, I don't even like honey!
I don't eat it!

  
We need to talk!

  
He's just a little bee!

  
And he happens to be
the nicest bee I've met in a long time!

  
Long time? What are you talking about?!
Are there other bugs in your life?

  
No, but there are other things bugging
me in life. And you're one of them!

  
Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...

  
My nerves are fried from riding
on this emotional roller coaster!

  
Goodbye, Ken.

  
And for your information,

  
I prefer sugar-free, artificial
sweeteners made by man!

  
I'm sorry about all that.

  
I know it's got
an aftertaste! I like it!

  
I always felt there was some kind
of barrier between Ken and me.

  
I couldn't overcome it.
Oh, well.

  
Are you OK for the trial?

  
I believe Mr. Montgomery
is about out of ideas.

  
We would like to call
Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.

  
Good idea! You can really see why he's
considered one of the best lawyers...

  
Yeah.

  
Layton, you've
gotta weave some magic

  
with this jury,
or it's gonna be all over.

  
Don't worry. The only thing I have
to do to turn this jury around

  
is to remind them
of what they don't like about bees.

  
- You got the tweezers?
- Are you allergic?

  
Only to losing, son. Only to losing.

  
Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you
what I think we'd all like to know.

  
What exactly is your relationship

  
to that woman?

  
We're friends.

  
- Good friends?
- Yes.

  
How good? Do you live together?

  
Wait a minute...

  
Are you her little...

  
...bedbug?

  
I've seen a bee documentary or two.
From what I understand,

  
doesn't your queen give birth
to all the bee children?

  
- Yeah, but...
- So those aren't your real parents!

  
- Oh, Barry...
- Yes, they are!

  
Hold me back!

  
You're an illegitimate bee,
aren't you, Benson?

  
He's denouncing bees!

  
Don't y'all date your cousins?

  
- Objection!
- I'm going to pincushion this guy!

  
Adam, don't! It's what he wants!

  
Oh, I'm hit!!

  
Oh, lordy, I am hit!

  
Order! Order!

  
The venom! The venom
is coursing through my veins!

  
I have been felled
by a winged beast of destruction!

  
You see? You can't treat them
like equals! They're striped savages!

  
Stinging's the only thing
they know! It's their way!

  
- Adam, stay with me.
- I can't feel my legs.

  
What angel of mercy
will come forward to suck the poison

  
from my heaving buttocks?

  
I will have order in this court. Order!

  
Order, please!

  
The case of the honeybees
versus the human race

  
took a pointed turn against the bees

  
yesterday when one of their legal
team stung Layton T. Montgomery.

  
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

  
- Is there much pain?
- Yeah.

  
I...

  
I blew the whole case, didn't I?

  
It doesn't matter. What matters is
you're alive. You could have died.

  
I'd be better off dead. Look at me.

  
They got it from the cafeteria
downstairs, in a tuna sandwich.

  
Look, there's
a little celery still on it.

  
What was it like to sting someone?

  
I can't explain it. It was all...

  
All adrenaline and then...
and then ecstasy!

  
All right.

  
You think it was all a trap?

  
Of course. I'm sorry.
I flew us right into this.

  
What were we thinking? Look at us. We're
just a couple of bugs in this world.

  
What will the humans do to us
if they win?

  
I don't know.

  
I hear they put the roaches in motels.
That doesn't sound so bad.

  
Adam, they check in,
but they don't check out!

  
Oh, my.

  
Oould you get a nurse
to close that window?

  
- Why?
- The smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke.

  
Right. Bees don't smoke.

  
Bees don't smoke!
But some bees are smoking.

  
That's it! That's our case!

  
It is? It's not over?

  
Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.

  
Get back to the court and stall.
Stall any way you can.

  
And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.

  
Mr. Flayman.

  
Yes? Yes, Your Honor!

  
Where is the rest of your team?

  
Well, Your Honor, it's interesting.

  
Bees are trained to fly haphazardly,

  
and as a result,
we don't make very good time.

  
I actually heard a funny story about...




Six things if you want to have any discussion with me:

1.) J.L.M is not France's Bernie Sanders, he's France's Fidel Castro or Leonid Brezhnev. He's much further to the left than Bernie Sanders & even Jeremy Corbyn are & he would take Social Democracy back to the 1960's. Emmanuel Macron wants to copy more modernized social democracy adopted by Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany & Canada since the 1990s which mixes strong labour flexibility with strong social safety nets, not copy the uber corporatist U.S & the U.K. Anyone who attempts to compare Melenchon to Bernie sanders is immediately dismissed from the conversation & will most likely result in you being blocked.

2.) J.L.M, M.L.P & F.F are Kremlin backed, Eurosceptic candidates that would allow Moscow to expand their influence & power into the West. Before you get pissed off at me & scream "But what about Emmanuel Macron being backed by the big banks?", acknowledge that he isn't, but rather he's backed by his working & lower class, as well as other loyal donors that give less than 50 Euro to his campaign per donation & this is a derailing tactic to shut down any meaningful conversation on Russian attempts to influence Western elections. Admit you don't care about Russia doing it because they're White, Christian conservatives, who lean to the left on economics. If it were Saudi Arabia, you guys would be screaming about influence in our elections & I'd agree with you. I have a very good feeling that there is some racist double standard here.

3.) M.L.P & J.L.M are nearly identical with the exception of green technology & blatant bigotry. if you want a French Bernie Sanders, vote for B.H, not J.L.M. He panders to people who are too afraid to support M.L.P, but want all of her other populist platforms. He is vehemently Eurosceptic & any attempts to rationalized or play down his anti E.U & pro Russia stance is doing a huge disservice. He probably realized that he had to tone down his rhetoric to gain voters, just like M.L.P.

4.) Do not under any circumstances compare Emmanuel Macron to Hillary Clinton or claim that he is backed by the French establishment. Also, do not compare him to Francois Hollande. Emmanuel Macron has some anti elitist policies & he is trying to get lower & working class people into politics & reform the French political system to make it more fairer, more democratic, less corrupt & more like the political systems found in the Netherlands, Germany & the Nordic countries. Just because he wants to reform some parts of the French economy doesn't make him a corporate sellout. Also, do not bring up his past @ Rothschild's to discredit him or to imply that he's working for the big banks. Unless you're willing to apply the same standards to J.L.M & M.L.P with the Russian gov't, then do not make this argument @ all.

5.) Any conspiracy theories such as "Eurabia", "Sweden is the rape capital of Europe due to Islamic immigration", "Germanistan", "Mama Merkel" & "Neoliberal elites" are entirely off the table, period. Even though there are some specs of truth to them, the conclusion that the people who espouse such unproven conspiracy theories & the arguments that these theories use are not true &/or are exaggerated deceptively & purposefully to radicalize disillusioned & sexually frustrated young white males who are nerdy &/or can't find a white girlfriend.

6.) Do not use any of the following buzzwords: Neoliberal, Austerity, Unelected Eurocrats, Mass immigration, secure our borders, N.W.O, globalist, Cultural Marxist, Swedenistan, Germanistan, Muslim rape gangs, M.S.M, Regressive Left, Cultural Marxist, Political Correctness or Politically Correct, S.J.W, cuck, mangina, Hillary Clinton or any such phrases. They're reactionary buzzwords that are nothing more than dog whistles to fire up the far right & the far left.

If you break any of the six rules above, you immediately blow having a conversation with me & I'm most likely going to resort to blocking you to keep you off my computer screen. Do not accuse me of being close minded, as I am rather open to new arguments & convincing evidence, from the other sides, but breaking any of the six rules above is not any evidence from the other sidesFapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you're also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would think it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person doesn't consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.u/_demetri_

Another week, another laundry load, you think to yourself as you climb down to the basement. You swing open the door, barely awake, not able to think of any relevant puns for a stupid Reddit thread, wearing your last-resort shirt from a decade old fundraiser and basketball shorts.
    
You groggily drop the basket down, opening the door to the washing machine, and on routine shove your week's clothes into the appliance. But when you reach for the laundry pods, the container's already opened.
     
Looking into it, you see not a single laundry pod, and no backup detergent anywhere in sight. Your momentary befuddlement is interrupted by a cute, demure "Excuse me?"
    
In shock, you turn around, and a creature unlike any you've seen before is inside the doorway. A translucent white is her unmistakably feminine body, but with odd transparent fringes along her "head" and behind her sparkling eyes. Her "snout", if you were to pick a word, has two small ridges, one blue and the other orange, glossy and glimmering. A similar pattern crosses her chest, one breast a deep blue and the other a bright tangerine. A floral scent fills the room, and you're getting the full effect of it with your jaw dropped at this creature's beauty.
     
You mumble something, the spark of recall dancing in your eyes along with the spark of arousal.
     
"You're missing some clothes..." She sidles up to you, giving you a glimpse of her round backside, again repeating the blue-and-orange motif. "I think what you're wearing could use a wash, too~"
     
Her half-closed eyes, and her bitten lip, give you all the hint you need. Your clothes join the rest of your laundry in the washing machine, and you embrace your newfound tropical-scented fling. As she hugs you, light squeaking noises, the sound of her taut plastic skin, fill the room, and the aroma becomes almost... alluring, no, intoxicating.
     
You plant a kiss on her head, on the orange ridge. She runs her mitten-like hands down your back, a refreshing and cooling touch to counterbalance your hot-running blood. "But... You're made of detergent, yet you're full of these dirty thoughts..." you stammer out.
      
"Don't ask questions, just do what comes naturally. Don’t you want to drink me...?" To answer your unspoken, truer question, she kisses you deeply, her unique lips embracing yours, her eyes closing as you join the forbidden love. With a close look at her translucent body, you see the turbulent flows of her inner detergent pulsing and swirling, and soon emotion closes your eyes so you can concentrate on feeling the love filling you both.
     
After an eternity you'd live and die again for of pure love between two unlikely beings, you break the kiss off, and her hand moves down your side, the taut skin sliding along your shaft. With a squeak she strokes the underside of your glans, winking at you. "There's one kind of dirty I'd love us to become, you know."
     
You'd almost swear in that moment that beneath the swirling white soapy face of hers it turned the slightest, blushing shade of pink as your firmness pushed into her horn base. You seductively unscrew her top, as she moaned.
       
“Yes, twist my tight fucking cap.” She moans, spilling between your fingers. You moan at her scent, as it beckons you, mechanically tipping her over as her begs you to sip. To drink.
      
“Yes Yes Yes DRINK DRINK ME RIGHT HERE ANDNOWYESYOUHAVEJUSTMETHERESONLYTHISRNDITALLYESYOUKNOWTHISISWHARYOUWANT*JESUSCHRISTTAKEME*”
      
Gulp after gulp, your eyes roll back in the highest form of ecstasy you’ve ever felt. *Yes* you think. *This is what I want. It’s so beautiful. I don’t want it to end, but I do want it to end.* The taste oh god the taste. You picture it’s taste as your mind covers everything you’ve ever known in Tide.You're mom gay lolWeird fact: the Easter Bunny was the source of a significant amount of theological debate during the 1200's, as Catholic philosophers debated why God would create a creature in a constant state of labor (and thus suffering). The Catholic Church ultimately resolved this question by declaring that the Easter Bunny orgasmed every time it laid it an egg (which it was doing constantly). This is now codified in Canon Law (the legal code of the Catholic Church and much of Europe in the pre-modern era) and saying that the Easter Bunny does not orgasm with every egg laid is considered blasphemy and grounds for excommunication from the Church.I👨am a😀 🎮GAMER🎮, not🚫🙅because I😤don't have a life☮️😍 but🍑because I👮 hate😠 ♀WOMEN♀ and 👩🏿MINORITIES👦🏿

God, did I hate him. Every introduction, he'd say, "I excel," stressing the latter word, "in herpetology." I wouldn't be surprised if I heard another French kid say a thing like that. Everyday, he kept boasting about his "intellectual" capabilities. He acted all chic with his French language and even had that annoying vain voice. He was tall and had straight, blonde hair. I was short, so he always looked down on me. He was adored by teachers, but cursed by students. At least students like me. I always had a grin when he was corrected. I hated when he waved to students after winning some award. He was accepted to this prestigious private school. Guess what? He says, "it's not good enough for me." He made my middle school year like hell. I'm glad he went back to France. Now honestly, the French aren't necessarily all arrogant and haughty. It's just they really have some really arrogant bugs.

Preface; I thought this was a conspiracy theory too but once you look there is so much information that you can't even deny it anymore. sad about this man 2 of my favorite artists ever.

Ok for all the people who think drake is soft yea he probably is but he has murderous criminals around him. Baka, long time security and friend now his signed artist went to jail for kidnapping and pimping. "as soon as Baka get back on the road". On "No Long Talk", Drake raps"

Just know man like Chubbs

He's a fixer if I ever gotta fix tings

Just know man like Fif, he’s a sickaz

You get tanned, he don’t miss things

.

His friends are murderers and he doesn't hide this fact, he's actually proud of it. Fif was killed in Toronto, people came up to him as he was going into his apartment building and shot him through the glass. When he says Chubbs is a fixer he means paying for murder. Paying for murder is an important theme here, don't foget it. All of these people have criminal backgrounds that can be looked up and researched. So this is not cap, Drake really hangs around killers. But what's important is the fact that he raps about it so specifically. He wants you to know it. He wants to prove that he's tough, that he's a gangster too. Drake has a pattern of trying to prove he's a gangster, and he has known connections to gangsters to help with this.

.

Main Thing Here Is PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR.

.

Ok so now we go to him and XXX. X did shit that crossed the line and he has a pattern of going WAY TOO FAR when he's angry. Posting pics of Drake's mom etc etc. He's also not a stranger to violence, look at his past, he's beaten people near to death multiple times. So in "I'm Upset" when he says "50,000 on my head is disrespect" Can we say this is not likely that X would do something like this? Especially if he was provoked. But what provoked him?

.

Ok so the Drake and X beef never died down. I believe most of it took place behind the scenes but I know moments that have escaped into the public. For example, on DJ Akademiks' livestreams with Trippie Redd and X, Drake was mentioned. It was in a context of Drake and X fighting over Trippie and Drake winning basically. This was like 3 months ago and the beef started over a year ago, so that lets you know that X wasn't letting this go. They're both petty dudes and X has been known to expose peoples' skeletons and he went on live 4 months ago and said he had a secret about Drake. This is when he posted the IG Story saying "if anyone tries to kill me its @champagnepapi im snitching" On a live video, X says drake would kill him specifically if he leaked the secret. That secret obviously was the baby that Drake has. I believe there was more to it than that. If X was able to get info about his son he probably had a few more skeletons on Drake. Plus on an account rumored to be owned by X drakes moms STD situation was made fun of. Beyond this, they simply could've been on a phone call and X could've said something(or many things) that was simply too far. Look at how far X went with Drake's mom. X has a pattern of going too far and in private things go farther.Pusha T has said he has more Drake disses and that Adidon was just the beginning so X could've gave Pusha some serous serious shit. Both X and Drake have been engaging in pettiness towards each other behind the scenes and it gets worse and worse. These petty actions might have prompted X to put 50k on Drake's head which Drake took as disrespect and killed X for.

.

On I'm Upset he mentions "XXX" right before he talks about doing a drive by shooting. Alone, this info is not even circumstansial, but in the mix with all this it is a key ingredient to a murder pie.

.

Another part of this theory is the God's Plan video. It's clear he copied the idea from X, X was doing similar things for a long while before this. It was ike an X thing to go do charity in te community. Still glad Drake helped people but it was clearly a petty move. And the God's Plan video was filmed IN MIAMI/BROWARD where X is from. This adds to the behavior pattern of Drake being petty.

.

Now to finish up by showing Drake's fake goon personality. He think's he's a gangster, and after this, he's kind of right. But a real mob boss wouldn't do this, it's just too far. Drake did this because he was trying to PROVE something. Look at the lyrics to I'm Upset. He talks about someone continuing to shoot at someone after they're dead. Drake probably has never seen a shooting but he tries to seem like he's in the streets, like by criticizing a murderer's handiwork he seems cooler than the murderer I guess. But Drake is clearly obsessed with seeing himself as a gangster. His fortnite username is "TheBoyDuddus". Duddus is a famous jamaican gangster, founder of "Shower Posse". They were called this because they would shower bullets, leaving like 100+ shell casings at crime scenes. Drake is also connected to J Prince who is known as a gang leader and has high ranking connections in the BGF, a black prison gang. Also, when DJ Akademiks mentioned his phone convo with Drake, Drake mentioned going to a "dark place". Being that Drake is very obviously insecure and trying to prove he's a gangster, all it would take is one disrespectful comment from X to take him into that dark place and pay for X's murder.

Not to mention X had beef with the Migos who are currently on tour with Drake. QC is also known to commit murders, 50&amp;#37; owner P is a known gangster and their artist Lil Baby is a cocaine salesman with ties to the Rollin' 60s in Atlanta. Drake has a song with Lil Baby. P sold cocaine as well. On "Walk It Like I Talk It" Drake raps "We been brothers since "Versace" ,"Bando"", early Migos songs circa 2011. It's clear these ties run deep.

.

The final nail in the coffin is on Look Alive when Drake says "They won't be expectin shit when Capo come to slide, cuz I told then that we put that shit behind us but I lied". This does two things. Shows that Drake had still not gotten over his beef with X, and it makes it even more clear of Drake's fake mobster persona. Drake let the beef die down to quell suspicion and once it was all clear drake paid the moeny and got X killed. But lets look at "Capo come to slide." A "Capo" is a kind of co-captain in the mob. Basically if the mob boss is the president the Capos are the governors. So he is using mob terminology to refer to sending his criminal associates to do a hit. On "Walk It Like I Talk It" he says "We live like Sopranos". The Sopranos is a Mob TV show.

.

A$AP Rocky was said to be involved with Pusha T finding out about Drake's son. On I'm Upset, Drake says himself "Flacko Jodye seen us put it down" meaning Rocky has seen Drake's gang do some criminal acts.

.

Maybe if the info was half of this I would call it a coincidence. But this is NOT a conicidence. There is so much more evidence out there that I will find. Look at podcast interviews of OVO members speaking about X. It's clear they hate this dude and want him dead. X literally said "If anyone kills me it's @champagnepapi IM SNITCHING". Rip X one of the gratest artists sad this all started cuz drake stole his flow smh so many fire collabs could've happened between them.

This is the original parody story:

Important to note that Semper Fi is the motto of the Marines, not the SEALs.

Sometimes, this passage is also included after the crocodile tears part:

It is believed to have been started because of this email dating back to 1996 about a brave christian standing up [to his atheist prof.](http://www.snopes.com/religion/chalk.asp) As an aside, here is a related comic about the classroom debate that [you can actually buy online.](http://chick.com/reading/tracts/0055/0055_01.asp) Here is a webpage with responses from that university denying that the [event ever happened.](http://www.holwick.com/questionable-illustrations/195-questionable-illustrations-chalk-dropping-professor.html) That page also features some variations of this story (prof asking theist students to leave class) and in 2004 we ended up with [this variation of the story.](http://msgboard.snopes.com/message/ultimatebb.php?/ubb/get_topic/f/82/t/000897.html)


>A United States Marine was taking some college courses between assignments. He had completed 20 missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. One of the courses had a professor who was an avowed atheist, and a member of the ACLU.

>One day the professor shocked the class when he came in. He looked to the ceiling and flatly stated, "GOD, if you are real, then I want you to knock me off this platform. I'll give you exactly 15 minutes." The lecture room fell silent. You could hear a pin drop. Ten minutes went by and the professor proclaimed, "Here I am GOD, I'm still waiting."

>It got down to the last couple of minutes when the Marine got out of his chair, went up to the professor, and cold-cocked him; knocking him off the platform. The professor was out cold.

>The Marine went back to his seat and sat there, silently. The other students were shocked and stunned, and sat there looking on in silence. The professor eventually came to, noticeably shaken, looked at the Marine and asked, "What in the world is the matter with you? Why did you do that?"

>The Marine calmly replied, "GOD was too busy today protecting America's soldiers who are protecting your right to say stupid stuff and act like an idiot. So, He sent me."

>The classroom erupted in cheers!


Sometimes the copypasta version ends with "The student's name was Albert Einstein." This is because yet another chain email was sent revolving around [the same topic.](http://seabiscuits.wordpress.com/tag/albert-einstein/)

Oh, shit. Wait. I know. It's because you're a wreck, both mentally and physically, and emotionally stunted. You think you're smarter and more intelligent than everyone around you, and therefore rationalize your own lack of success as a laughably absurd conspiracy theory wherein the world has passed you over because you're somehow too edgy for the mainstream masses to understand.

Or maybe you just tell yourself and others that you "don't give a shit" in a desperate attempt to make it hurt less when you see yourself getting older, fatter, and more out of touch while those you look down on are adapting to suit the needs of the world, and learning their limitations while you childishly deny your own.

Perhaps you have taken to telling yourself that women are only interested in "Alpha Males", those that reside at the top of a scale that only you adhere to, and it is THIS rigid table of identity that is holding you back, and allowing society to pigeonhole you. Perhaps you tell yourself that people don't share your very narrow range of hobbies and interests aren't (or wouldn't be) interested in you, and therefore do not even try to engage them. In actuality these are all mechanisms that allow you to blame your own failings on everyone around you, and project your own narrow-minded perceptions onto society as a whole.

You instead choose the easy option of sitting at your computer all day, shielded by the anonymity of the internet, screaming abuse and nitpicking the goals and achievements of your betters while arguing the tiniest deviation in the interests of your peers from your own with a startling lack of understanding and empathy. They are the only other people on Earth that you can relate to, and you hate them because they like slightly different things.

Oh yeah. That's why you don't have a girlfriend. I forgot, for a moment.Seriously? After 20 minutes of getting to choke this gorgeous girl with your cock, two little poots of cum is all you could manage? Pathetic. I registered and account just so I could comment in hopes that I  can make you see how selfish you are. Fronting like some alpha-male while Elizabeth is performing her heart out, and what do you give her? Two little twiddlywinks of cum? Pathetic. I've never felt more personally offended by porn before. You're a real asshole, pal.Once upon a time there lived an ugly man named Johnny Piclac. He was a weird looking person with green hair (that he didn’t want). He always wore a wig to school. His parents had purple hair with blue highlights. When Johnny was born, he was smacked three times by his mom, because she was dumb and thought it was a short murderer trying to attack her. Johnny still remembered that time………
“WAKE UP YOU IDIOT!!!!! IT’S TIME FOR BREAKFAST!!! GET CHANGED INTO YOUR STUPID CLOTHES AND COME DOWN!!!!!!!!” yelled Johnny’s mom. “Fine…” said Johnny. He snuck under his blanket, (his mom not noticing) and then punched her. “WOULD YOU STOP YELLING TO WAKE ME UP BLUBBER HEAD?!?!?!?” said Johnny. “ DON’T YOU DARE CALL ME THAT AGAIN, OR ELSE…” said Johnny’s mom, squeezing his wrist. “Alright...” said Johnny. “ I need an alarm clock…” he thought. When Johnny was at school, he thought of the end of a plan he had been planning for years. He forgot that he snuck his mini TV in his locker along with 50 boxes of bubblegum, a foldable TV, a laptop, over 1,000 pieces of crumbled up paper, and 5 sticks of dynamite. So when he opened his locker, EVERYTHING FELL ON HIM!!! While a student had matches, he was so surprised that the flaming matches flew out of his hand and landed on the dynamite! Johnny had already gotten to class, so a kid named Albert exploded because he was the only one near Johnny’s locker. His brain flew so high, that in class it crashed through the window and hit a student so he crashed into the teacher, Mrs. Frenchfri. Of course, she has 1,254 boxes of French fries. Johnny counted. Mrs. Frenchfri and the other student crashed through the wall. The teacher on the other side was so angry that he picked up a desk and threw it! He had really bad eyesight so he aimed it at Jake (another student) and it killed him. “2 people died at school today” Johnny said to his mom. “Wish you were one of them” Johnny’s mom said. “I almost was” said Johnny. “REALLY??” his mom said. “Yes” Johnny said. “DARN!” said Johnny’s mom. Johnny had remembered he set up his plan this morning. He had made a switch to start it. He ran into his room and pulled the switch. THEN ALL OF JOHNNY’S MOM’S KRUSTY KRUM UNDERWEAR FELL ON HIS MOM! ALL OF THE TRASH HAD BEEN THROWN AT THE HOUSE!  ALL OF HIS BEEBEE GUNS SHOT! And then for the finale, MILLIONS OF NUTS AND BOLTS FELL!!!!!!!!!!
 “Where is the refrigerator?” Johnny’s Mom thought. BOOM!!!!!!!!!
The refrigerator fell…   “YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!” Johnny shouted. When he went downstairs, his mom’s head already fell off. “JOHNNY!!!!!! WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING?!” said Johnny’s dad. He got out a bazooka and SHOT IT THROUGH THE DOOR! Johnny was already leaning down, looking at the head. So the shell went over Johnny. “GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW!” said Johnny’s dad. Johnny had a 50 foot rope, so he tied a knot around the refrigerator. He snuck some money from his mom’s wallet. He got the map he drew to the Tasmanian Devil shop. He threw the rope out of the window and snuck out. His dad was snoring in his room, like he always does. He slid down the rope, got into his mom’s car, and drove off. He was driving, when he saw a kid that was in his school. He didn’t like him, so he floored the car and crashed into the car! The kid flew out of the car and hit a hobo! He finally got to the store, so he went in. “Hello.” said the cashier. 30 Tasmanian Devils please. “WHAT???” said the cashier. “Make that 100” Johnny said. “Okay…” said the cashier. When Johnny was home, he had already bought an iron door. He replaced his dad’s room’s door with an iron door. He opened it, let all of the Tasmanian Devils lose in his room, and locked the iron door. AHHHH! JOHNNY! WHAT THE HE--. The Tasmanian Devils already killed him. He then noticed that… HIS MOM WAS ALIVE!!!!!! “JOHNNY!!!! I AM GONNA KILL YOU!!!!!!!!!” said Johnny’s mom. He opened the iron door, but the Tasmanian Devils already escaped!!! But when he opened the front door, the Tasmanian Devils were already dead… Pet control was there. “Who dares buy these illegal Tasmanian Devils?!” said Dan the pet control guy. Johnny hurried to school. At the recess area, There was a forest to the west of the school. Johnny’s friend, Mike dared Johnny to go in the forest. Rumors spreaded about a mine in the forest. Johnny went in. “This isn’t so bad”, said Johnny. Then he found some TNT lying next to a mine… “This could come in handy…”, said Johnny. He put the TNT in his backpack. He ran into school, holding a box of matches. He quickly put them in his backpack. The bully, Chris, was walking in school “HEY CHUBBY!”, said Johnny. JOHNNY PULLED OUT THE TNT, SET IT ON FIRE, AND THREW IT! But Mrs. Chesterfield was coming out!!!!! Mrs. Chesterfield caught it and threw it in the trash. BA-BOOM!!! THE TRASH CAN EXPLODED!!! “At least that was our cheapest one.” Said Mrs. Chesterfield. (Saturday). Johnny woke up. “My birthday!! YAY!” said Johnny. He ran downstairs. He ripped a present open. “THE MIGHTY MIKE ACTION FIGURE!!!!” screamed Johnny. “Speaking of Mighty Mike, the movie is coming on!! “THE MIGHTY MIKE!” the TV said. (At night.) “The Mighty Mike episode: Mike finds tunnels in his bedroom” Johnny thought. In his closet, there was a button. He always had wanted to press it. Johnny got up and pressed it. A secret door slid open… He went in. “HEY! GET OUT OF HERE!!!! I’M IN THE SHOWER!!!!” said someone. It was a secret house connected to Johnny’s house!! He closed the door and went to sleep. In the morning Johnny’s mom came into his room. “WAKE UP FLAPJACK! I SIGNED YOU UP FOR DUMB PEOPLE CAMP!” said Johnny’s mom. “MOM!!” screamed Johnny. “It’s only for the weekends, SO GET DOWNSTAIRS! Johnny finds the brochure. “Dumb Camp: For dumb ones to learn to be more normal and better.” “What?!?!?” said Johnny. He read on. “Make your child (Or children) obey you! Let them do whatever you want!” “ I know why she wants me to go here. So she can make me commit suicide. Well not today! Johnny got “DANNY DOUGLAS DODO BRAIN CREAM. ONLY USE ON DUMB DUMB PEOPLE.” He put some in a bowl. Johnny got some “PIGGY PIE. ONLY USE ON PIGS. IF USED ON PEOPLE WILL MAKE PERSON CHANGE PERSONALITY AND MAKE CHICKEN NOISES FOR A DAY”.  He put some in a bowl. Johnny got blue food coloring, and “SUPAH SALON SHAMPOO” He put both in. Johnny got some 9 inch long pills and put them in a blender. He blended them and put them in the bowl. Johnny shredded paper, put it in the blender, and blended it. He put it in the bowl. He ripped the sprouts in his mom’s garden and put them in the blender. Johnny put them in the bowl. He found a caldron and put the bowl stuff in the caldron. Johnny got a special blender and put the bowl in the blender!! VVVVVVV!!! He then blended his Mighty Mike action figure and put it in the caldron. Then he found some worms, and blended them. Then Johnny put a raccoon in the blender and blended it. He put it in the caldron. Then he put all the color food coloring in the caldron. Johnny stirred… and stirred… and stirred. He put some in a glass and gave it to his mom. “Drink it!” said Johnny. “Fine” said his mom. She drank it… She turned into a wolf to a giraffe to an elephant to a lion to a cat to a cheetah to a dog to a penguin to a panda to a person! “Hello Johnny! I love you!” said Johnny’s mom. She hugged him. “What did I do?!” thought Johnny.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, it's my first time getting it and it's from a terrible story I wrote as a kid, nice.A liberal Muslim homosexual ACLU lawyer professor and abortion doctor was teaching a class on Karl Marx, a known atheist.
"Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Marx and accept that he was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Jesus Christ!"

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life Navy SEAL champion who had served 1500 tours of duty and understood the necessity of war and fully supported all military decision made by the United States stood up and held up a rock.

"How old is this rock?"

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied "4.6 billion years, you stupid Christian"

"Wrong. It’s been 5,000 years since God created it. If it was 4.6 billion years old and evolution, as you say, is real… then it should be an animal now"

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Origin of the Species. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears. The same tears liberals cry for the "poor" (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. There is no doubt that at this point our professor, DeShawn Washington, wished he had pulled himself up by his bootstraps and become more than a sophist liberal professor. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered Republican that day and accepted Jesus as their lord and savior. An eagle named "Small Government" flew into the room and perched atop the American Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. The pledge of allegiance was read several times, and God himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

The professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the gay plague AIDS and was tossed into the lake of fire for all eternity.

Semper Fi Close The Borders So ever since FNaF 2 was released I've found myself somewhat attracted to Toy Chica. I know its kind of a meme or a joke but I need help.

It took a while before my attraction to her became sexual. While I know everyone has a fetish of some sort, I've always felt insecure about this and I was wondering if anyone could tell me if being attracted to her is normal. It is beginning to worry me.

Im not a furry and will never consider myself as one. Note that I was 10 years of age when this all started, which is close to the age that people develop fetishes. But please give me your opinion, does this make me a weird person?

*Somebody's response*

I feels ya my man, I completely understand. But I wouldn't say "attracted", I would say "looked up art of her and imagined" and that's what I did. I think your case is more serious, but since you technically should be younger than me since fnaf 2 came out when I was 12 so that should make you thirteen or fourteen right? You get a pass. I wouldn't stress over it just 'relief the tension' and forget about it. Heh. 'Relief the tension'. Oh yeah, since you seem to have a fascination for chica, what did you think about that panty shot scene? This shit just gets more ridiculous the more years get stacked on top of each other. Anyway, what did you think of that scene since... You know... Your 'situation'?OKAY SO BASICALLY, (context): I was out camping on a school field trip and I was horny so I masturbated in my tent and jacking off to some pictures I brought

I realised that when I was vigorously stroking my cock and approaching climax, I felt a sting on my dick and I thought it was due to the fact that I had like no lube. Ok so this is the worst part: When I climaxed, virtually nothing came out and I was surprised. I had tissue paper ready and to my horror, I found a frickin’ mosquito flying around with a white body and it was huuuuuge. Like the mosquito literally sucked my cum and flew around my tent in ecstasy. I came in a mosquito. OMG I got so turned on, I went straight for round 2.Thanos carI sexually identify as Harambe the Lowland Gorilla. Ever since I was a boy I have dreamed of eating fruits and plants in the captivity of a zoo. People say to me that being an endangered Lowland Gorilla is impossible and I'm fucking retarded, but I don't care, I'm a beautiful and strong silverback. I'm having a plastic surgeon install Gorilla arms, legs, torso, and a bulletproof vest on my body. From now on, I want you to call me Harambe and respect my right to eat, live with, and fuck other Gorillas. If you can't accept me you're a Gorilla murdering Zoophobe and you need to check your primate privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.Ight bitch first off I didn't text u that was my lil cousin sec off fucc u I don't want yo young ass ur ass ain't nothing but jail bait for me but hahaha u trying to put someone on blast thats funny cuz my lil cuz ain't all there so before u go off post shit find out who it is first u dumb ass bitch an u can post this cuz not a damn nice gonna have ur bacc to come fight cuz I promise u they all be leave in amblance if u don't believe me ask anybody on my fb they tell u ur not my fucci g type

I never wanted to breed with anyone more than I want to with Halloween Mercy. That perfect, curvy body. Those bountiful breasts. The child bearing hips of a literal goddess. It honestly fucking hurts knowing that I'll never mate with her, pass my genes through her, and have her birth a set of perfect offspring.

I'd do fucking ANYTHING for the chance to get Halloween Mercy pregnant. A N Y T H I N G. And the fact that I can't is quite honestly too much to fucking bear. Why would Blizzard create something so perfect? To fucking tantalize us? Fucking laugh in our faces?!

Honestly guys, I just fucking can't anymore. Fuck.Is having daughters the ultimate cuckoldry?

I cannot think or comprehend of anything more cucked than having a daughter. Honestly, think about it rationally. You are feeding, clothing, raising and rearing a girl for at least 18 years solely so she can go and get ravaged by another man. All the hard work you put into your beautiful little girl - reading her stories at bedtime, making her go to sports practice, making sure she had a healthy diet, educating her, playing with her. All of it has one simple result: her body is more enjoyable for the men that will eventually fuck her in every hole.

Raised the perfect girl? Great. Who benefits? If you're lucky, a random man who had nothing to do with the way she grew up, who marries her. He gets to fuck her tight pussy every night. He gets the benefits of her kind and sweet personality that came from the way you raised her. 

As a man who has a daughter, you are LITERALLY dedicating at least 20 years of your life simply to raise a girl for another man to enjoy. It is the ULTIMATE AND FINAL cuck. Think about it logically[removed]LOL 😅😂🤣 How🤷‍♂️ can 👦🏿Africa👦🏿 NOT🚫❌ get any water💧 when all they👥 got👉 to do💪 is👉 dig⛏ a 2️⃣✖️2️⃣ hole🕳 and 🅿️our💧2️⃣ water💦 🅱️uckets 🅰️t o🅿️🅿️osite c🅾️rners to Ⓜ️ake an infinite🔁 water🌊 source👍👌💯"I've never been a fan of Internet Explorer"

   Crowd laughs nervously and a few grunts are heard from the back seats as people edge closer to hear the punchline.

"Why not? Don't you like the internet?"

   The crowd suddenly stands up, aware that they are about to receive what they came for. People slowly edge closer to the set as Sheldon prepares for his next line. Sweat is clearly visible on his brow and his mouth is quivering in anticipation as he readies himself for what is about to happen.

"I just prefer Firefox because, like the fox, I am cunning and nimble."

   The crowd suddenly surges forward as the words escape Sheldon's mouth. They are so powerful, they almost shake the very foundations of the CBS studios. He watches as, in what he perceives as slow motion, the crowd moves toward his fragile body. He has been preparing for this moment his whole life. This is his moment. This is his Emmy. This is his Golden Globe. This is even his Oscar. The crowd converges around him so quickly they ignore the trampled cries of Leonard and Penny, who now lie shaking on the floor, their bones crushed by the sheer mass of the crowd. Sheldon stares back at the eyes around him. What he sees are no longer people. What he sees is the human psyche stripped down to its core. Their lives, what they were before this moment has been forgotten. Ravenous. Hungry. They want one thing from him. Sheldon closes his eyes, clears his mind and relaxes his body. What happens next depends completely on the next few seconds. The time between this and what he mutters next feels like an eternity. Slowly, he opens his eyes. He looks at Leonard, then at Penny, both lying lifeless on the floor. Without a second thought, he says with resounding conviction...

"BAZINGA"

   In a split second, the crowd pounces on his ready and waiting body. Man, woman, child all at once. Sheldon cries out in complete ecstasy as they consume his flesh. He stops suddenly, as he drifts into eternal slumber. Peace at last.Ｗｈａｔ ｔｈｅ ｆｕｃｋ ｄｉｄ ｙｏｕ ｊｕｓｔ ｆｕｃｋｉｎｇ ｓａｙ ａｂｏｕｔ ｍｅ, ｙｏｕ ｌｉｔｔｌｅ ｂｉｔｃｈ？ Ｉ’ｌｌ ｈａｖｅ ｙｏｕ ｋｎｏｗ Ｉ ｇｒａｄｕａｔｅｄ ｔｏｐ ｏｆ ｍｙ ｃｌａｓｓ ｉｎ ｔｈｅ Ｎａｖｙ Ｓｅａｌｓ, ａｎｄ Ｉ’ｖｅ ｂｅｅｎ ｉｎｖｏｌｖｅｄ ｉｎ ｎｕｍｅｒｏｕｓ ｓｅｃｒｅｔ ｒａｉｄｓ ｏｎ Ａｌ－Ｑｕａｅｄａ, ａｎｄ Ｉ ｈａｖｅ ｏｖｅｒ ３００ ｃｏｎｆｉｒｍｅｄ ｋｉｌｌｓ.

Stopping after another short burst of bobbing her head, the gal pulled free from the hog's engorged member and quickly spat on her hand which she followed up by using that same hand to rapidly stroke him.

"You like that baby?" Rogue questioned, her intense gaze locked with the blur's own. With the pleasure being so great, all Sonic could do in response was nod but even if he did want to say something, he'd never be able to do since in the amount of time it'd take for his answer to be out, the gal was already back to exploring his mouth with her tongue and this was happening while she was jacking him off. As time went on and as he continued to stare down at the gloved hand pumping his member like it was one of those bottled milkshakes, the blue blur was trying to piece together how this could've happened.

Of course, deep down he should've known that it was either due to his hormones or if he really wanted to be a dick to himself, it could've been that he was spineless and couldn't say no but those thoughts were either buried deep within his mind or they never existed in the first place because he sure as hell couldn't bring them out. Everything happened far too fast to really see it coming. One moment, the blur was just taking a nap. After that, Rogue came in and he thought he was just being a friend by comforting her and now, here he was now, being pleasured by that same girl almost as though nothing had happened and it all occurred in the span of minutes.

"What could've happened?" The blur asked himself. "Was there something in the air? Was it something he did? Did it have something to do with Chaos Energy?" All this and more never really got answered until much later though at least one thing was certain.

To Sonic, this was one of the best things to ever happen to him in his life and instead of trying to reject his feelings, he was going to embrace every moment of his enjoyment.

After about a minute or two, the blur had shrugged off his all his worry and concern and was kissing back harder than ever before. The intimate but one-sided dance was becoming a thing of the past as the two pink bits of flesh were now like two ticked off pythons trying their best to strangle the life out of one another which was more than a nice surprise for the mutant who as absolutely revelling in not just the attention he was giving her but just how much better it was than Gambit's in every single way.

The feel of his tongue struggling for dominance against hers, the way his hands caressed every curve and bump. All of it was like fine wine, it was so delicious and intoxicating which left Rogue wondering if he was only going to get better with age since for all she knew, this was his first time and yet here he was, massaging her almost like he had done this over a hundred times before. It was so good in fact that she regretted having to push his hands away and see the disappointment in his eyes.

However, that wouldn't last long as a few moments later, following the period of her jacking him off with her only stopping every now and again to spit on his cock to lube it up, the gal finally decided it was time get his lower region "reacquainted" with her oral cavity. After one final kiss, Rogue turned her attention back to the twitching eager rod and sucked it back right into her mouth with Sonic letting a soft moan escape from his lips following the return of that comforting warmth.

Noticing the blur's newly developed grin, the mutant decided that it was time to go all in and like what she did before and deepthroated all 9 or so inches of the massive shaft, a move that caught the hog completely off-guard though it didn't take long for him to really get back into it, especially once he heard the light bits of gagging. After a few more seconds of holding the pole of flesh, Anna went right back into her groove and started bobbing her head once more with the pace increasing with seemingly every passing second. Now completely under the influence of his pleasure and with a muttered curse, the blur shut his eyes with his hand instinctively finding a resting place on the mutant's head, a sign that the gal correctly took as him not wanting her to halt her magic.I, /u/CummyBot2000, am confessing on the subreddit /r/Copypasta that I am a pedophile, a wanted and known pedophile in the state of Virginia.Lindsay was 12 when it first started. One morning she awoke to find odd little crumbs in her bed. At first she thought they were crackers, but as she was getting dressed for school she noticed a small little tan 'O' laying on the floor next to her nightstand. It was a cheerio. She picked it up and looked at it for a moment, its wholesome oaty contours seeming perfectly harmless. She threw it away, assuming that her bratty older sister was responsible. Little did she know that it was an omen of the pure mind bending horror which was soon to follow. That weekend her mother went shopping.

She had gotten in the habit of doing all the grocery shopping for the month at once, so the kitchen was packed full of bags and boxes as the girls went about putting things away. Lindsay was disappointed when she noticed that the only cereal her mother had gotten was Cheerios. It was always Cheerios. Four economy-sized boxes worth, no less. Lindsay had never liked Cheerios, even though her sister seemed to love them. They were too plain. Too boring, She thrust the boxes carelessly up onto the shelf above the refrigerator and went searching through the other bags to see if her mother had gotten anything that was actually edible. Later that night she was tossing and turning in bed, her stomach full of slightly too much Butterfinger ice cream. The house was silent. Everyone else was in bed. Or should have been. Lindsay had almost dozed off when a soft, dry rustling sound brought her back to wakefulness. At first she thought it was the cat scratching at her door, but as she sat up she realized it was coming from somewhere inside the room. A twinge of fear shivered through her body. They'd never had rats or mice in the house before. Was it a bug?

Whatever it was, it sounded big. Lindsay was scared. She felt the urge to huddle underneath her blankets and hide until it went away. Instead, she gathered her courage and reached out to turn on the lamp beside her bed. Just as she touched it, the noise suddenly stopped. She flicked it on and jumped back into the center of her bed, clutching the sheets tightly around her as light spilled out into the room. There was nothing there. She peeked carefully over the sides of her bed, seeing only the rug and a few Girls' Life magazines. Taking her heaviest pillow to use as a weapon, she got out of bed and padded slowly towards the door. Right as she reached it she froze. looking down. Peeking out from the crack beneath her round half-circle of a cheerio. Puzzled, she opened the door. Before her loomed a seven-foot wall of cheerios.

They covered the doorway completely as the entire hallway had been filled with them. And they were moving. They were alive and crawling over each other like a mass of legless insects, filling the air with the heavy smell of whole grain oats. Lindsay ran and jumped back onto her bed. She huddled and clutched the pillow over her head, and screamed. She was still screaming when her parents came in. Her mother soothed her, wanting to know what was the matter. The cheerios were gone. Lindsay told her that it was just a nightmare. She didn't want them to think she was crazy. After a little while her parents left, her father muttering something about 'night terrors' as they walked back upstairs.

When they were gone, Lindsay stuffed her blanket under the crack of her door and sat up with the light on. She tried her best to stay awake all night, but after a few hours she finally fell asleep. When she awoke there were a handful of crumbs in her bed. For a few weeks afterward Lindsay was able to sleep on the floor in her sister Susan's room, though she had to use all of her allowance as a bribe. Then her parents found out and made her go back to her own room. Lindsay's dad got her a lock for the door, telling her it would help her to feel safe. It didn't.

The very first night she was back in her room, she heard the rustling noise again. She'd kept the lamp on but this time the light didn't seem to help. She huddled there, watching the door and hoping it would go away. Then the blanket moved. She'd stuffed it under the door again as tightly as she could, but now the corner of it was being pushed back into her room by something on the other side. Lindsay was pretty sure she knew that something was. The cheerios were coming for her. Just then the lamp went out and the room plunged into darkness. She stifled a scream, telling herself it was just a nightmare.

Cheerios couldn't move or unplug lights. They didn't come after people. Then something light and dry brushed against her cheek, and all rational thought left her mind as she was seized in the cold grip of terror. She opened her mouth to scream, gagging as it was immediately filled with tiny rings of cereal. She felt it moving all over her body. She bit and chewed and spit, trying to clear her mouth so she could call for help. But no matter how much of it she crunched up, more always took its place. The cheerios seemed to collect into narrow tendrils as they snaked over her body. She shuddered in shock and disbelief as she felt the buttons of her pajama top being pulled open one by one. Suddenly she was grabbed around the arms and ankles and lifted up above the bed, her face toward the ceiling.

Dry, searching fingers of cereal probed into the waistband of her pj bottoms and yanked them down just as her shirt was pulled up over her head. She was still too young to wear a bra, and she immediately felt the cheerios coil around her small, developing breasts and squeeze them roughly. Lindsay whimpered and kicked as her panties were stripped off. No, she thought, it couldn't want that. *Please* let it not be that... Her legs were quickly restrained while another tendril slid up slowly along her inner thigh. thousands more gripped her buttocks, holding her up and kneading her firm athletic flesh as more began circling over her nipples. Lindsay gasped through her nose, her mouth still full of cheerios. It was weird and horrible, but the touching felt good at the same time.

Then she felt the tendril rubbing lightly over her exposed labia, and she thrashed about uselessly as it began nudging and probing at her most private spot. It caressed the lips of her young vulva almost tenderly for a few long minutes before she felt it nudge harder at the entrance to her vagina. Her body stiffened as she felt it pushing inside her. It felt rough, even though the surface had been moistened by her fearful sweat and the natural wetness within her. The cheerio tendril entered her slowly, relentlessly. It didn't thrust in and out like she'd expected it to, instead it seemed to be pouring itself into her, filling her vagina with tiny cereal O's.

She could feel them snapping and crunching inside her as she clenched down to try and keep them out. The tendrils on her body seemed to get stronger. groping at her breasts and ass and tugging hard at her nipples. She felt her pussy stretching as it was packed full of rapacious cheerios, the growing pressure sending mixed tingles of pain and pleasure rippling through her body. Then she felt the presence of yet another narrow tendril rubbing insistently against the tight pucker of her butthole. Lindsay came as it pushed inside her, her body shivering uncontrollably as she was reluctantly overcome by pulsing waves of ecstasy. At that moment there was a quiet knock on the door. Her mother's voice called out, asking if she was okay. The cheerios quickly drew away, vanishing into the darkness just as abruptly as they'd arrived.

Lindsay could still feel some remnants in her vagina and ass as she got up weakly and pulled her pjs back on. Her mother looked concerned when Lindsay opened the door, but the explanation of another nightmare seemed to put her at ease. When she'd gone back up to bed, Lindsay went into the bathroom and sat on the toilet, feeling ashamed and violated as she let the last of the soggy cereal mush drip out of her body. She still hated cheerios. Now more than ever.Oh wow! You had SEX! Congratulations!

Just kidding. 

Having sex is literally the most basic, desperate, tragic, hopelessly-void-of-meaning, outrageously obnoxious, troublesome, costly, and downright pointless cry for help that the universe has ever screamed. Wow, you were born as an objectively good looking, decent looking, or perhaps borderline acceptable member of your species. WOW! INCREDIBLE! You managed to procure a willing (which in evolutionary terms, willing translates roughly to "fucking desperate for at least a few reasons") mate and managed to somehow perform the act of intercourse with her! WOW! This his literally only been taking place for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF FUCKING YEARS! WOW! Except guess what, you probably wore a condom... which means you failed at submitting yourself to an act which means absolutely nothing. The only thing left to do now is kill yourself.﻿Yesterday, during our scheduled Furry Hour, my 7 year old refused to be cooperative right from the start. Eventually, he threw a tantrum, telling me "I don't want to learn about furries anymore. This is stupid. I wish I could go to school like all the other kids."

Needless to say, I was devastated. I tried to tell him that the reason I homeschool him is because the public school system does not respect our beliefs and practices. I reminded him of the time his first grade teacher called child services because I barked at her during our parent-teacher conference. He didn't want to hear any of it though, so I just left him alone to do a Math worksheet.

I haven't talked to him today yet, and I'm trying not to be upset at him, but it's so hard. Please, have any of your children gone through this phase with homeschooling, and if so how did you handle it?Do you know how fucking hard it is? Do ANY of you know how fucking hard it is? To go 26 FUCKING YEARS without even kissing another human being? To go 26 FUCKING YEARS with not even an OUNCE of intimacy in your life? No....of course you don't! You're all Chads and Staceys. You guys just fuck any slut you want. And you girls just fuck the top 20% of men. And don't fucking deny it, it's scientifically PROVEN! Girls rate 80% of men on OkCupid as BELOW AVERAGE. Guys like me, average looking guys, guys who are a little on the short side, we don't even FUCKING EXIST to you! We're the guys who run your fucking errands for you, help you move your shit, who treat you with nothing but respect and what do we get in return? FUCKING NOTHING! Not a hug, not a peck, NOTHING! And then you have the FUCKING audacity to turn "nice guys" into some FEMINIST buzzword and accuse us of being CREEPS! News flash: you only think we're creepy because we aren't ATTRACTIVE! If Chad does the same shit, you can't even wait to take off your soiled panties for him! Well, fuck you! My names is Danny Fuckin' Struthers, and I'm a fucking virgin! Don't like it?

This community is fucking atrocious right now. You're all acting like a bunch of whiny, entitled little babies.

A tiny team of people made an animated adventure for you to embark on. They made it for YOU, and they're going to wake up tomorrow morning and see that instead of enjoying it, this community of "fans" picked out the 3 or 4 things that weren't perfect and are using that to fucking riot.

Guess what? The movie was never going to be perfect. It was never going to live up to your hype. It was never going to be everything you'd ever want in a movie.

What it WAS going to be was an impossibly epic adventure filled with action and funny shit. I just watched it for an hour and a half and it was exactly that. What more do you want?

Is it simple? Sure. Is it repetitive? Maybe. Is the product placement jarring and the jokes questionable and the structure unclear? Sure, fine.

But holy shit what do these people OWE YOU?

How fucking entitled do you have to be to have the appventure of a lifetime inside a smartphone and then say "yeah but…"

We should all be fucking weeping in our chairs right now at the sheer size and scale of the achievement. We should be showering the people behind this thing with the praise they deserve for pulling off one of the most inspiring movies in recent memory.

Sony Pictures doesn't owe you a good time. Yet they gave you 86 MINUTES worth.

If you have the fucking audacity to complain about it then you don't deserve it and you were never fans in the first place.
